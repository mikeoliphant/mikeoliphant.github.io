<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Khao Tom (Thai Rice Soup)</div><br/><br/>Often served for breakfast. Shrimp can be substituted for the meatballs. I often dilute the chicken stock by about a third. Minced lemongrass can be added to the flavoring paste if available.<br/>Serves 2.<br/><br/>2 cups chicken stock, unsalted<br/>2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped<br/>1/4 teaspoon white peppercorns<br/>4-8 cilantro stems, minced<br/>2 1/2 ounces ground pork<br/>2 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce, divided<br/>1 teaspoon soy sauce<br/>2 cups cooked jasmine rice<br/>1 green onion, thinly sliced<br/>1 teaspoon cilantro, chopped<br/>Pickled mustard greens (optional)<br/>2 eggs, cooked singapore style (optional)<br/>Freshly ground white pepper, for serving<br/><br/><br/>Heat the stock. Pound the garlic, peppercorns and cilantro into a coarse paste using a mortar and pestle. Mix about half of the paste into the pork along with about a half teaspoon of fish sauce and a pinch of salt. Shape into mini-meatballs and set aside.<br/><br/>When the stock is simmering, add the 2 teaspoons of fish sauce and 1 teaspoon soy sauce, then add the mini-meatballs. Simmer about a minute, then add the rice and heat another minute or two.<br/><br/>Ladle into warmed bowls and crack an egg into each bowl (if using). Top with green onion and cilantro. Serve with pickled mustard greens, white pepper and extra fish sauce at the table.<br/><br/><br/></div></body>
