<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Smoked Polish Sausage - Kielbasa</div><br/><br/>I like a mixture of Pecan and Apple woods, but Hickory or Oak would work too.<br/>These smoked sausages can be eaten cold, or better yet, grilled.<br/><br/>5 pounds fatty pork meat, ground (eg shoulder with fat cap)<br/>1 cup non-fat dry milk<br/>3 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt (2 1/2 tablespoons table salt)<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar<br/>1 teaspoon Insta-Cure #1 or DQ Curing Salt<br/>1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper<br/>3 garlic cloves, minced<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons dried marjoram<br/>2 teaspoons cayenne chili powder<br/>1 cup very cold water<br/>====<br/>Natural hog casings<br/>Smoke wood chunks and/or chips<br/><br/><br/>Combine all ingredients and mix will. Cover and let chill in the refrigerator overnight (optional). Stuff into well-rinsed casings and tie off sausages  - loops are traditional. Refrigerate uncovered on a rack until dry or hang from smoking rack for 30-60 minutes to dry the casing. <br/><br/>Smoke the sausages starting at about 110 degrees and slowly bringing the temperature up to about 180-190 (I use a tray of water to help control the temp and add steam.) Smoke 3-4 hours to an internal temp of 150-155 degrees.<br/><br/>Upon removing the sausages from the smoker, place in a sink and shower with cold water about 10 minutes or until the internal temp is about 110. Then hang at room temp for about 30 minutes to allow the color to darken (bloom). Store refrigerated or freeze.<br/><br/></div></body>
