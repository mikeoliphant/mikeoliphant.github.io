Note: Use the fresh hops as soon after picking as possible; store fresh hops for wet/dry hopping refrigerated in an air-tight container.<br/><br/>5 lb 2-Row Pale Malt<br/>1/2 lb Wheat Malt<br/>1/2 lb Carapils/Dextrin Malt<br/>5 1/4 lb Briess Golden Light Dry Malt Extract (DME)<br/>10 oz Whole, Fresh Cascade Hop Flowers (est. 8% AA)<br/>7.5 oz Whole, Fresh Nugget Hop Flowers (est. 11% AA)<br/>1 tablet Whirlfloc<br/>White Labs WLP001 California Ale Yeast<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Hop Schedule:</div><br/>1 oz fresh Nugget - 60 minutes boil<br/>1/2 oz fresh Nugget - 45 minutes boil<br/>1 oz fresh Cascade - 30 minutes boil<br/>1/2 oz fresh Cascade - 15 minutes boil<br/>1 oz fresh Cascade - 10 minutes boil<br/>1/2 oz fresh Nugget - 5 minutes boil<br/>3 oz fresh Cascade - 0 minutes boil - flameout<br/>3 oz fresh Nugget - 0 minutes boil - flameout<br/>1 oz fresh Cascade - 5 minutes boil<br/>3 1/2 oz fresh Cascade - Wet Hop in Secondary Fermenter<br/>2 1/2 oz fresh Nugget - Wet Hop in Secondary Fermenter<br/><br/><br/>Heat 8 quarts water to 165 degrees for a target mash temperature of 150 degrees. Place the 6 pounds of crushed grain (2-Row Pale, Wheat and Carapils) into a large mesh bag. Pour the hot water into the beverage cooler, then lower the grain bag into the water very slowly, pushing and prodding with a large spoon to ensure all the grain is wet (this can take several minutes). Put the lid on the cooler and allow to rest 60 minutes.<br/><br/>While the grains are mashing, heat another 5-6 quarts of water to 180-185 degrees for sparging (rinsing the grains). Near the end of the 60 minutes, heat 2 quarts of water to a boil in your brew pot.<br/><br/>After the first mash is complete, remove the cooler lid and open the spigot to draw off about 2 quarts of wort into a large pitcher. The first few draws will likely be cloudy with grain particles; pour it gently back into the cooler over the grain bag to help filter it. Draw off the remaining wort by the pitcher-full and carefully pour that wort into the boiling water in your brew pot; continue until only a trickle of wort leaves the spigot. Pour about 5 quarts of your hot sparge water over the grain bag in the cooler. Gently lift the bag up and down to thoroughly re-wet the grains (but don't slosh). Cover and let sit about 5 minutes. Use the spigot and a pitcher to draw off all of the second wort and add it to your brew pot.  (Alternatively, heat the sparge water to 195 and carefully add it a pint at a time while you draw off the first wort. Keep the liquid level 1 inch over the grain bed until all sparge water has been added, then slowly draw off the remainder.)<br/><br/>You should have about 3 gallons of wort. Bring the wort to a boil, add 2-3 drops of anti-foam (optional) and add the whole, fresh hop flowers according to the schedule. With 20-25 minutes remaining in the boil, begin adding the DME one cup at a time, stirring to dissolve. Stir in 1 tablet Whirlfloc. At time zero, carefully stir in the last of the hops, remove from heat, cover and let sit 10-15 minutes.<br/><br/>Move brew pot to an ice bath and cool quickly to less than 80 degrees.  Strain off the hops then transfer wort to a primary fermenter.  Add water to reach the 5 gallon mark.  Swirl vigorously then pitch the yeast.<br/><br/>Ferment in primary for 1 week, then transfer to secondary. After 3-7 days, add 3 1/2 oz whole, fresh Cascade hop flowers and 2 1/2 oz whole, fresh Nugget hop flowers. Bottle or keg after fermentation is complete (1 to 2 weeks in secondary).<br/><br/></div></body>
