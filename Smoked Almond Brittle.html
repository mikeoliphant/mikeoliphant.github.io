<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Smoked Almond Brittle</div><br/><br/>This recipe can easily be doubled or even quadrupled.<br/><br/>1 cup Smoked Almonds<br/>3/4 cup sugar<br/>2 tablespoons water<br/><br/><br/>Coarsely chop the smoked almonds and spread them out on a sheet pan. Toast them in a 400 F oven for about 5 minutes, then set aside to cool. Lightly grease another sheet pan with butter, or line it with a Silpat baking mat.<br/><br/>Put the sugar into a small, heavy-bottom sauce pan. Stir in 2 tablespoons of water and set over medium heat. Without stirring, let the sugar come to a boil and watch carefully until it starts turning a golden, caramel color (about 15 minutes). Just before it hits the color you want, pull the pan from the heat and quickly stir in the nuts. Immediately dump the mixture onto the prepared sheet pan and use a silcone spatula to spread it out into an even layer about a quarter-inch thick.<br/><br/>Let the candy cool completely and then break it into attractive, irregular pieces. Stored in an airtight container, the brittle will keep for several weeks.<br/><br/></div></body>
