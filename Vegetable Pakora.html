<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Vegetable Pakora</div><br/><br/>Pan roasted garlic is an easy way to soften the garlic and mellow its flavor. Simply place whole, unpeeled garlic cloves in a dry frying pan at medium high heat. Cook, turning frequently for about ten minutes or until the skin is blackened in some places and the garlic gives when pushed.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Ingredients:</div><br/>2 small carrots, peeled and grated<br/>1 small zucchini, grated<br/>1 small potato, peeled and grated<br/>1/4 onion, thinly sliced and cut in 3/4-inch lengths<br/>1/2 serrano chile, minced<br/>1 egg<br/>1 teaspoon oil<br/>1 1/4 cups gram flour, plus more if needed<br/>1/4 teaspoon turmeric<br/>1 teaspoon garam masala<br/>1 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek leaves, crumbled<br/>1/4 teaspoon cayenne<br/>1 garlic clove, pan roasted and mashed<br/>vegetable oil for frying (peanut or canola)<br/><br/><br/>Blanch the carrots, zucchini and potato in lightly salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain and let cool in the strainer for 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>Stir together the vegetables, onion, chile, egg, garlic, oil and spices until thoroughly mixed. Add the gram flour and blend. The batter should be fairly loose, but not runny.<br/><br/>Put about 2 inches of oil into a heavy, high sided pan and heat to 375 degrees. Using two large spoons, scoops some batter with one and carefully push it into the hot oil with the other. The pakora should immediately rise to the surface forming irregular ball shapes -- if it sinks, the oil is not hot enough. Work in batches to avoid over-cooling the oil and cook each pakora to a deep brown color, about 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Serve hot or at room tempurature.<br/><br/></div></body>
