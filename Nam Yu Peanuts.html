<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Nam Yu Peanuts</div><br/><br/>An interesting snack with an unusual and addictive flavor.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Ingredients:</div><br/>3 12oz packages of peanuts, skin on<br/>5-6 chunks (2 1/2 oz) fermented red bean curd<br/>4 tablespoons water<br/>1 teaspoon salt<br/>3 teaspoons sugar<br/><br/><br/>Preheat your oven to 400Â°F.<br/><br/>In a small bowl, mix the bean curd, water, salt and sugar together until completely smooth. If it seems too thick, add some more water.<br/><br/>In a wok or skillet, stir-fry one of the packages of peanuts over medium to high heat. You may want to turn on your overhead oven fan if you have one. Once the nuts are starting to color, add three tablespoons of the bean curd mixture one tablespoon at a time, mixing it through. After a few more minutes, pour the peanuts into a large sheet pan (preferably one with high enough sides to keep things from spilling over). Repeat the process with the remaining two packages of peanuts.<br/><br/>Spread the peanuts evenly on the sheet pan and put them in the oven. After about 10 minutes, remove them and stir them around to redistribute. If you have bean curd mixture left over, add some more and stir it through. Put the peanuts back in the oven and repeat this process two or three more times. If some of the peanuts char a bit, that is fine - but you don't want them to burn too much.<br/><br/>Let the peanuts cool. When they are warm, they will not seem like they are going to be crunchy, but don't worry - they will be fine after resting.<br/><br/></div></body>
