I cut each fillet in half so they would fit in the wok. It also made it easier to handle the fish.<br/><br/>Heat the wok. Add oil to wok. Stir in garlic and ginger and stir fry for 30 seconds. Add white parts of scallion and fish and stir fry for 1 minute. Turn the fillets over after one minute. Add wine, water, soy sauce, black vinegar, sugar and black pepper. Cover and simmer on low for 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Add cornstarch slurry and stir to combine. Pour sesame seed oil over the fish and sprinkle the green part of the scallions. Serve hot.<br/><br/></div></body>
