<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Spanish Sausage</div><br/><br/>This sausage is sort of a take on Spanish Chorizo with plenty of paprika flavor.<br/><br/>The sausage meat is easier to grind and stuff into casings if kept quite cold. Over-working along with too much warmth softens the fat and can result in a spongy textured sausage.<br/><br/>2 1/2 pounds pork shoulder (with plenty of fat)<br/>1 teaspoon fennel seeds<br/>2 garlic cloves<br/>1/3 cup dry white wine<br/>1/4 cup sweet paprika<br/>1 1/4 teaspoons half-sharp paprika<br/>1 1/4 teaspoons cayenne pepper<br/>3 teaspoons kosher salt<br/>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br/><br/><br/>Cut meat into finger-shaped strips. Grind coarsely along with the whole fennel seeds and garlic cloves. Chill 1 hour. Mix in the remaining seasonings, using a light hand to keep the meat texture from going mushy. Pinch off about a tablespoon of sausage and cook it in a small fry pan. Taste for seasoning - add additional chile or salt if required. Chill the sausage meat at least 2 hours or overnight before stuffing into hydrated and rinsed hog casings.<br/><br/></div></body>
