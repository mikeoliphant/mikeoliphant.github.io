<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Hummus with Oven-Dried Tomatoes</div><br/><br/>This is our go-to hummus recipe with the bonus addition of the tomatoes and hot sauce. We like it on the bright, acidic side.  If that isn't your preference, you may want to reduce the lemon juice and/or up the amount of tahini.<br/><br/>1/2 garlic clove<br/>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed<br/>1 1/2 tablespoon tahini<br/>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br/>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil<br/>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>2 tablespoons Oven-Dried Tomatoes<br/>1 tablespoon Taco Shop Hot Sauce<br/><br/><br/>Put garlic into the food processor and pulse to mince. Add drained chickpeas and pulse again. <br/><br/>Scrape down sides of bowl and add tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, tomatoes and hot sauce. Blend until smooth, scraping sides of bowl as needed. <br/><br/>Taste and supplement any of the ingredients if needed.<br/><br/></div></body>
