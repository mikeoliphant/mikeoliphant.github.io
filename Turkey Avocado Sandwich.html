<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Turkey Avocado Sandwich</div><br/><br/>Serves 2.<br/><br/>1 ripe avocado, preferably haas<br/>1/2 lime<br/>2 rustic sandwich rolls<br/>Thinly sliced cooked turkey<br/>1 ripe tomato, sliced<br/>Baby lettuce greens<br/>White wine vinegar<br/>1/2 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil<br/>Kosher salt<br/><br/><br/>Preheat the broiler. <br/><br/>Cut the rolls in half, horizontally.  Place them on a small baking tray, cut side up, and put under the broiler until lightly browned and toasty.  Remove from heat and allow to cool a few minutes.<br/><br/>Halve the avocado, discard the seed, and scrape the flesh into a bowl.  Using a fork, coarsely mash the avocado.  Sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and add a squeeze of lime juice.  Stir and taste -- add additional salt or lime as needed.<br/><br/>Put a couple handfuls of the baby greens into a bowl.  Drizzle with the vinegar and olive oil, plus a pinch of salt.  Mix gently with your hands.  The greens should be just barely dressed, not drippy.<br/><br/>Spread about a quarter of the avocado mash onto the bottom half of each roll.  Top with turkey meat (about 2 slices) followed by a couple slices of tomato, then carefully add a handful of dressed greens.  Place the top on each sandwich, and press gently to stablize the stack.  Serve immediately.  <br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Note:</div><br/>Cover the left-over seasoned avocado mash with plastic wrap, by putting the plastic into direct contact with the avocado itself.  The less air reaches the avocado, the more it will keep its green color and fresh flavor.  Store in the refrigerator for up to two days.<br/><br/></div></body>
