<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Ubiquitous Curry Base Sauce</div><br/><br/>This recipe makes enough for base sauce for three curries â€“ make it ahead and freeze each portion in a ziptop bag for a quick, easy start to a great curry.<br/><br/>4 large onions, chopped<br/>1/3 cup canola oil<br/>4 tablespoons crushed garlic<br/>4 tablespoons crushed fresh ginger<br/>1 tablespoon ground coriander<br/>2 tablespoons ground paprika<br/>2 teaspoons turmeric<br/>2 (14 ounce) cans plum tomatoes (whole or diced)<br/>3-4 cups water<br/>2 teaspoons salt<br/><br/><br/>In a large pot or dutch oven, heat oil, garlic and ginger to medium-high. Add spices (coriander, paprika, turmeric) and stir to make a paste. Cook about 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Add onions and salt. Cook 3-5 minutes to soften onions. Stir frequently. If spices stick, add a tablespoon of water.<br/><br/>Add tomatoes. If using whole tomatoes, break them up by giving each a quick squeeze in your hand while adding to the pot.<br/><br/>Fill both tomato cans with water. Stir the water into the sauce and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer about an hour.<br/><br/>Remove from heat and allow to cool.<br/><br/>Puree to a smooth sauce using a blender or immersion blender (our favorite -  they are very handy).<br/><br/>Divide into three equal sized portions. Use within 8-10 days, or freeze.<br/><br/></div></body>
