<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Pancetta</div><br/><br/>For pork belly smaller than suggested in the recipe, adjust the quantities accordingly, but make sure you have sufficient cure to coat all sides.  For a 3-pound slab, I used 3/4 of the cure.  A kitchen scale that can weigh very small quantities is helpful, but not necessary.  The instructions are mostly straight from the book (Charcuterie, by Michael Ruhlman & Brian Polcyn), with just a little paraphrasing to match my experience.<br/><br/>1 (5 pound) slab pork belly, skin removed<br/>2 tablespoons (20 grams) coarsely ground black pepper, reserved for drying period<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The Dry Cure:</div><br/>4 garlic cloves, minced<br/>2 teaspoons (12 grams) pink salt<br/>1/4 cup (50 grams) kosher salt<br/>2 tablespoons (26 grams) dark brown sugar<br/>2 tablespoons (20 grams) coarsely ground black pepper<br/>2 tablespoons (10 grams) juniper berries, crushed and with the bottom of a small sauté pan<br/>4 bay leaves, crumbled<br/>1 teaspoon (4 grams) freshly grated nutmeg<br/>4-5 sprigs fresh thyme sprigs<br/><br/><br/>Trim the belly so that its edges are neat and square. <br/><br/>Combine the ingredients for the cure in a bowl, and mix thoroughly so that the pink salt is evenly distributed. Place the belly in a nonreactive container just large enough to hold it. Rub the mixture all over the belly, turning it several times to give it a uniform coating over the entire surface. <br/><br/>Cover and refrigerate for 7 days. Flip it over every other day and gently redistribute the seasonings with your fingers (a process called over-hauling). <br/><br/>After 7 days, check the belly for firmness. If it feels firm at its thickest point, it’s cured. If it still feels squishy, refrigerate it on the cure for 1 to 2 more days. <br/><br/>Remove the belly from the container, rinse it thoroughly under cold water, and pat it dry. Sprinkle the meat side with the 2 tablespoons of reserved cracked pepper. Starting from a long side, roll pork belly tightly, as you would a thick towel, and tie it very tightly with butcher’s string at 1-inch intervals; it’s important that there are no air pockets inside the roll (it can’t be too tightly rolled). (Alternately, the pancetta can be left flat, wrapped in cheesecloth, and hung to dry for 5 to 7 days.) <br/><br/>Using the string to suspend it, hang the pancetta in a cool, humid place to dry for 2 weeks. The ideal conditions are 50 to 60 degrees with 60 percent humidity, but a cool, humid basement works fine, as will most any place that’s out of the sun. Humidity is important: If your pancetta begins to get hard, it’s drying out and should be wrapped and refrigerated. The pancetta should be firm but pliable, not hard. Because pancetta isn’t meant to be eaten raw, the drying isn’t as critical a stage as it is for items such as prosciutto or dry- cured sausages. But drying pancetta enhances its texture, intensifies its flavor, and helps it to last longer. <br/><br/>After drying, the pancetta can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for 3 weeks, or more, or frozen for up to 4 months. Freezing makes it easier to slice thin. <br/><br/><br/></div></body>
