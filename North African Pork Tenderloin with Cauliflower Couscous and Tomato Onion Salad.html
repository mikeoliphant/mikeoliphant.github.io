<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">North African Pork Tenderloin with Cauliflower Couscous and Tomato Onion Salad</div><br/><br/>One tenderloin prepared as directed will yield 3 servings, while the couscous and salad will serve 4 to 5. It is easy to make two tenderloins, just double the rub amounts and continue as directed. <br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For each Pork Tenderloin:</div><br/>1 (approx. 1 pound) whole Pork Tenderloin<br/>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>1 large garlic clove<br/>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br/>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br/>1 tablespoon olive oil<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the Couscous:</div><br/>2 tablespoons olive oil<br/>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br/>1/4 teaspoon tumeric<br/>Kosher salt<br/>3 cups small cauliflower florets (1/2 to 1-inch pieces)<br/>1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed<br/>1 large shallot, peeled and cut into 1/8-inch slices<br/>3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth<br/>3/4 cup couscous<br/>1 teaspoon red wine vinegar<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the Salad:</div><br/>1 pint grape tomatoes<br/>1 small white onion<br/>2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro<br/>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br/>Kosher salt<br/><br/><br/>Preheat the oven to 400' F. Sprinkle the salt onto the garlic clove and mince together until the garlic and salt forms a paste. Mix in the 1/4-teaspoon cumin and 1/8-teaspoon ceyanne.<br/><br/>Trim the tenderloin removing most of the tough silverskin. Cut a couple of inches off the thin, pointy end so that you have a more uniform shape - it will cook more evenly. Save the small piece for another use. Rub the garlic mixture all over the pork and leave at room temperature about 30 minutes. <br/><br/>Prepare the Salad: cut each grape tomato crosswise into 2 or 3 pieces. Thinly slice and then chop the onion into 1/2-inch lengths. Mix together the tomato, onion, cilantro, vinegar and salt (about 1/4 teaspoon). Taste for seasoning and adjust with additional vinegar or salt as needed. Keep at room temperature until ready to serve.<br/><br/>Prepare the Couscous: Mix together the 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon tumeric and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Put the cauliflower florets on a baking sheet and sprinkle with the spice mixture. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss gently. Place into the hot oven. After 15 minutes, add the shallot slices and chickpeas to the pan and roast an additional for 10 minutes or until the cauliflower is tender. Right after placing the chickpeas in the oven, heat the chicken broth on high in a small saucepan. As soon as it reaches a boil, stir in 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and the couscous. Immediately remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes, then fluff with a fork and stir in the roasted cauliflower and chickpeas. Drizzle the teaspoon of vinegar over the couscous and toss. Keep warm until ready to serve.<br/><br/>Finish the Pork Tenderloin: Heat an oven-proof frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add a tablespoon of olive oil. Sear the pork tenderloin, 2-3 minutes per side or until nicely browned. Put the pan into the 400' oven (with the cauliflower) for 15-17 minutes. When done, remove from oven and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2-thick medalions. <br/><br/>Serve the salad, couscous and sliced pork together on warmed dinner plates.<br/><br/></div></body>
