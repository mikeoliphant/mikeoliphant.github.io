<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Arroz con Porco</div><br/><br/>Mike browned onion and pork shoulder, then braised it. I added 1 t paprika and 1 t smoked paprika and salt and pepper. Salt to taste, plus 1/2 teaspoon for the rice. Sauted 3/4 cup jasmine rice in olive oil until fairly opaque, added 1 minced garlic for 30 seconds more. Stirred into the braise, covered and simmered for about 25 minutes. Removed lid, fluffed, added parsley and let sit for 5 minutes.  Served with more parsley sprinkled on top.<br/><br/></div></body>
