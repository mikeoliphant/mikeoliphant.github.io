<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">BBQ Jalapeno Chicken - aka Green Jalapeno Chicken</div><br/><br/>The recipe book calls this "Jerk Chicken" which really makes no sense. I often refer to it as Green Jalapeno Chicken because the marinade is a bright, lime green color.<br/><br/></div></body>
