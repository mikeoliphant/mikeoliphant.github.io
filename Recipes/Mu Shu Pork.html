Drain the lilly buds, then cut off and discard any hard tips. Drain the black fungus, then cut it into thin slices. Discard any hard, knobby parts (or mushroom stems if using).<br/><br/>In a small bowl, combine the cooking sauce ingredients and set aside. Cut the green onions into 1 1/2-inch pieces, then into long shreds.  Set aside half of the green onion slivers for serving at the table.<br/><br/>Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add the eggs, stir gently and cook quickly until the eggs are just softly set. Remove from pan and set aside.<br/><br/>Increase the heat to high and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the ginger, followed by the pork and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes or until the pork is lightly browned. Stir in the lilly buds and black fungus. Cook about 1 minute, then add the bamboo shoots, carrot, lettuce, green onions and cooking sauce. Continue to stir-fry until the lettuce just begins to wilt, 1-2 minutes. Break the scrambled eggs into bite-sized pieces and return them to the pan. Mix through, then transfer to a warm serving bowl. Serve immediately with hoisin sauce, shredded green onion and Mandarin Pancakes.<br/><br/>At the table, allow each guest to prepare their own servings: spread a little hoisin sauce on a mandarin pancake, top with some Mu Shu and green onion slivers, roll, eat, repeat.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
