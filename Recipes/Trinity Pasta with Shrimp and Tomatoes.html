<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Trinity Pasta with Shrimp and Tomatoes</div><br/><br/>The shrimp and sauce for the pasta will cook while the pasta is cooking (usually 9 to 11 minutes), so be sure your saute pan is hot and everything is ready to cook before you drop the pasta into your boiling salted water. (Serves 2)<br/><br/>1 pound large shrimp, head-on<br/>2 stalks celery, diced small<br/>1/2 onion, diced and small<br/>1/2 green bell pepper, diced and small<br/>2 medium tomatoes, diced<br/>4-5 ounces uncooked pasta<br/>1-2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or as needed<br/>Kosher salt<br/><br/><br/>Heat a large pot of water for the pasta. Rinse and drain shrimp. Remove the heads and peel the tails, retaining both the heads and shells. Remove the vein from the back of each shrimp, then rinse, drain well and set aside.<br/><br/>Heat a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil, then the shrimp-heads and shells. Let simmer, stirring occasionally. After 5 minutes, add a few tablespoons of water to the shells and stir. Repeat as needed to create a few tablespoons of seafood broth. <br/><br/>Add salt to the boiling pasta water then drop the pasta. (Cook until al dente, then drain and add to the finished sauce and shrimp, below). <br/><br/>Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, then add the shrimp in a single layer. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, turning once, until pink on the outside and just opaque in the centers. Sprinkle lightly with salt, remove from pan and set aside. If necessary, add more olive oil to the saute pan. Place about 2/3 of the celery, onion and bell pepper into the hot pan, sprinkle with kosher salt and saute about 2 minutes, reduce heat. Drain the seafood broth from heads and shells into the vegetable mixture and stir through. Add the remaining celery, onion and bell pepper just before pulling the pasta.  <br/><br/>When the pasta is done, drain and mix with the sauce. Top with the cooked shrimp and chopped tomato, Stir gently and serve.<br/><br/><br/></div></body>
