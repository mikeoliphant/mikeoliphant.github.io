Too one-dimensional.<br/><br/>2 pounds broccoli, cut into bite-size florets<br/>4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil<br/>1 teaspoon whole coriander seeds (or 1/2 teaspoon ground)<br/>1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds (or 1/2 teaspoon ground)<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br/>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br/>1/8 teaspoon hot chili powder<br/>1 pound large shrimp, shelled and deveined<br/>1 1/4 teaspoons lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)<br/>Lemon wedges, for serving<br/><br/><br/>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, toss broccoli with 2 tablespoons oil, coriander, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and chili powder. In a separate bowl, combine shrimp, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, lemon zest, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper.<br/><br/>Spread broccoli in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast for 10 minutes. Add shrimp to baking sheet and toss with broccoli. Roast, tossing once halfway through, until shrimp are just opaque and broccoli is tender and golden around edges, about 10 minutes more. Serve with lemon wedges, or squeeze lemon juice all over shrimp and broccoli just before serving.<br/><br/></div></body>
