<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Vietnamese Grilled Chicken</div><br/><br/>I typically do 5 or 6 thighs at a time. Adjust marinade volume as needed for quantity of meat.<br/><br/>2 pounds chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on)<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br/>1/2 teaspoon sugar<br/>2 teaspoons black pepper<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons neutral oil<br/><br/><br/>In a bowl large enough to hold the chicken, mix everything except the chicken and oil.<br/>Remove the bones and excess fat from the thighs. Add thighs to the marinade and coat each piece well. Add the oil, and mix again. <br/>Let sit at room temp up to 2 hours, or place in the fridge 3-8 hours in advance.<br/>Grill thighs on a medium hot grill, starting skin side down. Turn as needed until skin is fairly crisp and chicken is done - about 13-15 minutes.<br/>Let rest 10 minutes, then slice the thighs into strips about 1/2 inch wide. <br/><br/></div></body>
