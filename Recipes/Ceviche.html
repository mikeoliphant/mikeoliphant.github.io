<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Ceviche</div><br/><br/>Ceviche is like a salsa, but with the addition of raw fish. The fish is “cooked” by citrus juices and gets an amazing texture impossible to achieve with  standard cooking methods. It is generally served in individual bowls  and eaten with a fork or spoon as an appetizer, but is also very tasty  eaten as a salsa with tortilla chips, or like a bruschetta piled on thinly sliced and toasted frenchbread. This recipe will easily serve  four, but any remaining can be kept in the fridge for a day or two. <br/><br/>1/2 pound fresh white fish fillets, diced into 1/2-inch pieces (haddock, halibut, etc.)<br/>juice from ½ large lemon and 2-3 limes (about 2/3 cup)<br/>2 medium tomatoes, diced<br/>1 plum tomato from a can, diced<br/>2 tablespoons tomato sauce<br/>1/2 cup chopped onions (about 1/2 a medium)<br/>1-2 green chiles, seeded and minced (jalapeno or serrano)<br/>2 tablespoons olive oil<br/>1/2 teaspoon oregano<br/>1/2 teaspoon basil<br/>1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>1/8 teaspoon pepper<br/>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro<br/><br/><br/>Put the fish into a glass dish and pour the lemon/lime juice over it. Stir gently and make sure that most, if not all of the fish is submersed. Cover and chill for about 6 hours, stirring once. The fish will become opaque when it is finished -  the time needed will depend on the thickness of the fish pieces.<br/><br/>Use a slotted spoon to remove the fish from the juice and set it aside. Measure and retain ¼ cup of the juice in the glass bowl (discard excess). Mix all remaining ingredients into the juice and then add the fish and stir gently. Note that for the tomato sauce, juice from the can of plum tomatoes works well if it is a thick, rich juice.<br/><br/>Chill for an hour to allow flavors to meld, then let the ceviche sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving. <br/><br/><br/></div></body>
