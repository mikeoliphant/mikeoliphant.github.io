<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Bibimbap</div><br/><br/>Use more vegetables than you think you’ll need; the rice works really well with them. Don’t fill the bowls more than about half way - it’s easier to stir everything together if there is enough space.<br/><br/>Rice: use short grain rice like you would for sushi. Cook just prior to assembling the bowls.<br/><br/>Meat: use about 2 oz thinly sliced lean beef per person. Tri tip cut into thin 1x2 inch strips works well. Marinate the meat for about 30 minutes while prepping the vegetables (see marinade below). Just before assembly, quickly fry the beef until just cooked.<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Marinade for approx. 4 oz beef:</div><br/>1 tablespoon gochujang<br/>1 tablespoon minced garlic<br/>1 teaspoon minced ginger<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce<br/>1 Tbsp sweet rice wine or 2 t mirin<br/>1 tablespoon sesame oil<br/>2 teaspoons brown sugar<br/>1 t korean red chile pepper flakes (optional)<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Gochujang-sauce for at the table:</div><br/>1 1/2 tablespoons gochujang<br/>1 teaspoon minced garlic<br/>1 tablespoon soy sauce<br/>1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar<br/>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil<br/>1 teaspoon brown sugar<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Prep your vegetables:</div><br/>Cook each separately and then season with a bit of salt, minced garlic and sesame oil. <br/>Use an assortment as desired and Blanch in boiling water for the time indicated.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Veg:</div><br/>Green onions cut into 2 inch pieces (10 seconds)<br/>Onion, cut into strips (20 seconds)<br/>Chard or Spinach, 1-2 inch pieces (20-30 seconds)<br/>Zucchini cut into batons (45-60 seconds)<br/>Carrots cut into matchsticks (60 seconds)<br/>Beansprouts (a must have!) (60 seconds)<br/>Mushroom, sliced (saute until softened)<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Assembly:</div><br/>Heat the dolsots directly on the stove starting with medium-low heat. Once hot, brush a nice coating of sesame oil onto the inside of each bowl (about 1/2 t per bowl). Spoon some warm, cooked rice into each bowl making sure it is in good contact with the hot stone, then increase the heat to medium. <br/><br/>Arrange the prepared toppings in small piles over the rice. You should hear some sizzling; continue cooking until rice touching the bowl is lightly golden and crisp, and toppings are warm through. Add a raw or fried egg to the center of the bowl if desired.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">To Serve:</div><br/>Carefully place each bowl on a wooden trivet at the table. Once the rice reaches the desired crispness, diners should dollop a generous spoonful of gochujang-sauce into their bowl and mix everything together using a long handled spoon. Enjoy!<br/><br/></div></body>
