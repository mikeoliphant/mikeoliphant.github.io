<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Egg Slut</div><br/><br/><br/><br/>1/3 cup cold potato puree<br/>1 egg<br/>Salt<br/>2 pieces warm buttered toast, cut into sticks<br/><br/><br/>Butter the sides of a one cup mason jar. Add puree and make a slight divet or well in the top. Carefully crack an egg into the jar and seal loosely with a lid. Fill a pot of water so that it comes up to the halfway point on the jar(s). Bring to a boil. Put a folded towel in the bottom of the pot and use a canning lifter to place the jar(s) in the water. Cover with a lid and simmer 10.5 minutes (2.4 on left front burner). Remove from heat and let sit 2 minutes. Remove the jar(s) from the water and let sit another minute. Remove lids and serve with the toast sticks. Best eaten with long handled teaspoons.<br/><br/></div></body>
