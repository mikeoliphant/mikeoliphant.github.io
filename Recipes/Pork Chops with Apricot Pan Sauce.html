<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Pork Chops with Apricot Pan Sauce</div><br/><br/>The pan sauce is a simple chicken broth simmered in the pan once the chops were removed. A teaspoon of apricot preserves adds a little sweetness and complexity. Add salt and pepper to taste and thicken slightly with a corn starch slury.<br/><br/>Pork chops were brined for 90 minutes in the refrigerator then rinsed and allowed to rest 30 minutes. (Brine: 1 tablespoon kosher salt per 1 cup cold water plus a teaspoon or so brown sugar.)<br/><br/></div></body>
