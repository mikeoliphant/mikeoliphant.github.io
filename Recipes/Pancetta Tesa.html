<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Pancetta Tesa</div><br/><br/><br/><br/>1 (2.5 pound) slab pork belly, skin removed<br/><br/><br/>2 tablespoons (30 grams) kosher salt<br/>4 teaspoons (15 grams) brown sugar<br/>1 1/4 teaspoons pink salt<br/>2 garlic cloves, minced<br/>5 teaspoons coarsely crushed black pepper<br/>4 teaspoons coarsely crushed juniper berries<br/>2 bay leaves, torn<br/>1/4-1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (optional)<br/><br/><br/>Trim the belly so that its edges are neat and square. <br/><br/>Combine the ingredients for the cure in a bowl, and mix thoroughly. Place the belly in a nonreactive container just large enough to hold it (or use a sealable plastic bag). Sprinkle the mixture all over the belly, turning it as needed to give it a uniform coating. <br/><br/>Cover and refrigerate for about a week. Flip it over every day and gently redistribute the seasonings with your fingers. After 7 days, check the belly for uniform firmness. If it still feels squishy, return it to the fridge for another 2 or 3 days. <br/><br/>Once cured, remove the belly from the container, rinse it under cold water, and pat it dry. Lightly oil a metal rack and place it on a shallow tray. Place the belly on the rack, fat side up, and refrigerate uncovered for up to two weeks. When the pancetta is nicely solid, but not too hard or dry (usually 6 to 9 days) place it in a plastic bag and return to the refrigerator for another 3 or 4 days. This will help rehydrate any hard edges or corners.<br/><br/>When ready to use, cut into lardons or cubes, saute gently and add to your favorite salad or pasta. Portion the remainder into 2 to 6 ounce pieces and freeze for future use.<br/><br/></div></body>
