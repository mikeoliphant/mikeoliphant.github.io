<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Sherry Bread </div><br/><br/>We use two variants of a single recipe for making flat bread to have with curry and tortillas for having with Mexican food.<br/><br/>2 cups flour<br/>1 teaspoon salt<br/>1/2 cup water, lukewarm<br/>1/4 cup evaporated milk, room temperature<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">for flat-bread --:</div><br/>1 teaspoon baking powder<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons canola oil<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">for tortillas --:</div><br/>1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br/>3 teaspoons canola oil<br/><br/><br/>In a large bowl mix flour, salt and baking powder together. Add oil to flour mixture and mix with your fingertips to combine.<br/><br/>Add water and milk, mixing with your hands to form a soft dough.  Knead on a lightly floured surface for 1 minute. Dough should be “earlobe’’ soft and not sticky.<br/>Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Divide dough into 8 or 12 balls (depending on how big you want them to be), cover, and let rest another 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Heat a heavy griddle or skillet (dry) over med/high heat for 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Roll each ball into a disk – as thin as possible for tortillas, and about ¼ inch thick for flat-bread.<br/><br/>Cook each bread about 30 seconds on each side, or until it looks dry and slightly wrinkled with a few brown specks.<br/><br/>Place each finished bread into a plastic bag while you finish the cooking remaining dough – this helps them stay soft until time to serve.<br/><br/>Serve warm, wrapped in a dish towel. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge for several days, and then briefly microwaved in a loose plastic bag.<br/><br/></div></body>
