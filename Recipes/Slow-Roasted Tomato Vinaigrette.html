In a small shallow baking dish, place tomato halves cut-side up. Drizzle with 2 tbsp canola oil. Sprinkle liberally with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Toss the seasoned tomatoes with the chopped garlic and thyme sprigs. Reposition tomatoes, making sure they are still cut-side up. Bake tomatoes at 200 degrees for 2 1/2 hours until tomatoes are completely tender/cooked through and starting to shrink up.<br/><br/>Once the tomatoes are done, remove the thyme from the pan. Allow the tomatoes to cool slightly until you are able to handle them. Remove the skins of the tomatoes over the baking dish. The tomatoes will be mostly liquid and not hold thier shape so be careful! They could be hot!<br/><br/>Pour all of contents of the baking dish and the red wine vinegar into a blender or food processor. Blend. While blending, slowly drizzle in 3 tbsp canola oil. <br/><br/>Pour the tomato vinaigrette into a bowl. Stir in the finely chopped tarragon. Season the vinaigrette with freshly cracked black pepper and kosher salt to taste. <br/><br/><br/></div></body>
