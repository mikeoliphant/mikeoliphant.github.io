<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Banh Mi Bread and/or Hamburger Buns 2025</div><br/><br/>I make 4 banh mi buns and 5 hamburger style buns at the same time from one batch of dough.<br/>I use King Arthur or Bob's Red Mill bread flours. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used to reduce the pH and promotes a better rise.<br/><br/>450 g good quality bread flour<br/>260 grams water<br/>1 egg (~50g unshelled or ~58g with shell)<br/>8 g instant yeast<br/>12 grams salt<br/>3 grams sugar<br/>1.8 g ascorbic acid<br/><br/><br/>Mix everything except flour. Add flour, mix on low speed to combine - about 2 minutes. Mix about 5 minutes on medium speed. Increase speed to high and mix another 3 minutes. Add additional water by the teaspoon or tablespoon if needed. Dough should stick to the bottom of bowl somewhat. Stop mixer and check dough for stretchiness and hydration. Mix an additional 3-5 minutes on medium or medium-high speed if needed.<br/><br/>Form dough into a ball and place on lightly oiled cutting board. Coat with oil and cover. Let rest 20 minutes.<br/>Form dough into small balls: 4 x 107 grams and 5 x 70 grams. Cover and let rest another 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Flatten each small ball into a disk to remove large bubbles and then shape into small balls again. Be sure to pinch the bottoms completely closed. Set aside.<br/><br/>Flatten each larger ball into a long triangle shape. Starting from the small pointy end, repeatedly roll and pinch until you have a small log shape that is puffier in the middle and tapers on the ends. Set on a bagette pan. Spray with water, cover and let rest about an hour. Spray as needed.<br/><br/>Re-flatten each small ball to achieve a hamburger bun shape. Place on a parchment lined pan, spray with water, cover and let rest about an hour.<br/><br/>Preheat oven to 350; Once the 5 small buns are very poofy, bake about 20 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool.<br/><br/>Increase oven to 450; Once the 4 banh mi buns are very poofy, spray them, slash with a razor blade and bake with steam for 8 minutes. Open door to remove steam pan and bake another 7-8 minutes. Cool on wire rack.<br/><br/></div></body>
