<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Hot Sauce</div><br/><br/>Makes about 7 5-oz bottles.<br/><br/>Approx. 50 fresh, hot red chiles (eg. 30 small serranos, 20 thai bird, and 5 large ceyanne)<br/>4 1/2 cups red wine vinegar, divided<br/>1 large red bell pepper<br/>1 large white onion, roughly chopped<br/>1/2 large red onion, roughly chopped<br/>8 garlic cloves<br/>4 teaspoons sugar<br/>4 teaspoons salt<br/><br/><br/>Rinse the chiles and drain well. Cut off the chile stems and discard. Cut chile lengthwise and remove the seeds (leave some in for additional heat). Bring 1 cup red wine vinegar to a simmer and blanch the chiles 4-5 minutes to soften. Set aside to cool.<br/><br/>Roast the red bell pepper until the skin is charred. When cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin, seeds, core, and stem. Place the flesh in a food processor along with the onions and garlic cloves. Add the blanched chiles and process to a fine puree, adding some of the blanching vinegar to loosen the mixture if necessary. <br/><br/>Pour the chile puree into a saucepan and blend in the remaining vinegar.  Bring to a low simmer and cook gently 15 minutes. Run the cooked puree through a food mill or strainer to remove large pieces of skin and seeds, then return the strained hot sauce to the pan and simmer another 5 minutes to sanitize.  Transfer to clean, sterilized bottles (detailed instructions for safe handling and storage can be found at Lerners.com).<br/><br/></div></body>
