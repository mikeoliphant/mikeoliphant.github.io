<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Salbutes</div><br/><br/>Makes 12. I like to make the masa the night before to allow it to fully hydrate. Leftover dough can be refrigerated several days. Rest at room temperature at least 30 minutes before frying.<br/><br/>1 1/4 cups masa harina<br/>3/4 cup hot water (or more)<br/>1/3 cup AP flour<br/>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br/>oil for deep frying<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Toppings:</div><br/>Shredded chicken<br/>Shredded lettuce or cabbage, seasoned with lime juice<br/>Sliced or diced tomato<br/>Minced onion and cilantro<br/>Sliced avocado<br/><br/><br/>Mix the masa harina and water and let sit for at least 30 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. Add additional warm water as needed. Dough should be soft, but not sticky. <br/><br/>Divide into 12 balls; keep covered with plastic. One at a time, press into a 4-inch disk and fry in hot oil (375 degrees) for 30-45 seconds per side. (Left burner set to #4.) The salbute should puff up, but not brown or turn crispy. Drain on a layer of paper towels while cooking the next one.<br/><br/>To serve, sprinkle on a bit of everything and top with a slice of avocado.<br/><br/></div></body>
