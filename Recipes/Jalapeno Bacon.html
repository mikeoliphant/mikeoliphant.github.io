<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Jalapeno Bacon</div><br/><br/>This bacon works best if somewhat fatty rather than lean. <br/><br/>1 (3-4 pound) slab pork belly, skin on<br/>40 grams (3-4 tablespoons) kosher salt<br/>20 grams (approx. 5 teaspoons) sugar<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons pink salt<br/>4 canned jalapenos in escabeche, plus 1-2 tablespoons of the liquid<br/>4 garlic cloves, sliced or crushed<br/>2 bay leaves, torn into small pieces<br/>1 tablespoon black peppercorns, slightly crushed<br/><br/><br/>Mix together the salt, sugar and pink salt. Sprinkle generously over all sides of the belly, then gently shake off the excess. Place the belly into a non-reactive dish or zip lock bag. Blitz the jalapeno with the pickling liquid in a food processor or blender. In a bowl, stir the garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns into the jalapeno, then add to the belly being sure to coat all sides fairly evenly.<br/><br/>Let cure in the refrigerator 5 to 8 days, turning the belly every other day. The meat is ready once it is reasonably firm when pressed. Remove the belly and rinse off the cure with cool water. Pat dry, place on an oiled rack and return to the refrigerator to dry -- uncovered -- overnight.<br/><br/>Smoke at 150-180 degrees using apple and oak. The bacon is ready once it reaches 150 degrees, usually in about 3 hours.<br/><br/></div></body>
