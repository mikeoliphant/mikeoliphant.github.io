<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Vietnamese Marinated Vegetables</div><br/><br/>Usually finely julianned carrot and daikon for Banh Mi.<br/><br/>1 large carrot, peeled<br/>1 4-inch piece of daikon radish (about 1 1/2 inch diameter), peeled<br/>1 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>2/3 cup rice wine vinegar<br/>2 1/2 tablespoons sugar<br/>1 (2 inch) piece cucumbers, peeled<br/>1 jalapeno<br/><br/><br/>Cut the carrot and daikon into 2-inch lengths. Julianne each (matchstick or thinner) and place into a bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Using your hand, massage the salt throughout the vegetables. Let sit for 5 or 10 minutes, at which point a piece of carrot should bend in half without breaking.<br/><br/>Add the sugar to the rice wine vinegar and stir until completely dissolved. Thoroughly rinse and drain the carrot and daikon. Return them to the bowl and cover with the vinegar-sugar marinade. Let sit at room temperature about an hour.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, cut the cucumber into 1/4-inch sticks (discard the seedy center). Cut about half of the jalapeño into thin slices. Taste to assess the heat level - if very hot, cut the slices in half. Add the cucumber and jalapeño slices to the carrot-daikon mixture for the last 30 minutes.<br/><br/>To use, grab a generous pinch of vegetables and gently shake, but do not drain. Use as a condiment or garnish. Makes enough for about four 6-inch Banh Mi. Extra carrot and daikon can be stored with the marinade in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks (discard extra cucumber or jalapeno).<br/><br/></div></body>
