<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Thai Summer Slaw</div><br/><br/>Light and refreshing, yet with punchy vibrancy and zing.  I substituted savoy cabbage for the original napa cabbage with good success.  For transporting to a picnic or potluck, put the slaw ingredients into a large sealable container and take the dressing along in a small bottle.  Add the dressing to the slaw, reseal, and shake to combine to an hour before serving -- the salad stays nice and crispy.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Slaw:</div><br/>2-3 cups thinly sliced napa cabbage or  savoy cabbage<br/>1/2 cup julienne-cut yellow squash (1/8-inch strips)<br/>1/2 cup julienne-cut zucchini (1/8-inch strips)<br/>1/2 cup julienne-cut red bell peppers (1/8-inch strips)<br/>1/2 cup julienne-cut yellow bell peppers (1/8-inch strips)<br/>1/2 cup julienne-cut, seeded, peeled cucumbers (1/8-inch strips)<br/>1/2 cup shredded, peeled carrot<br/>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br/>1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions<br/>1/4 cup grated radish<br/>1 minced, seeded jalapeno pepper<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Dressing:</div><br/>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice<br/>1 tablespoon fish sauce<br/>1 tablespoon water<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar<br/>1/2 teaspoon chile paste with garlic (such as sambal oelek)<br/><br/><br/>In a large bowl, toss together all 11 Slaw ingredients.<br/><br/>Whisk the Dressing ingredients in a small bowl until the sugar has fully dissolved.
