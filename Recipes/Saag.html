When hot, add fenugreek and stir for 30 seconds. Add onion and cumin, saute until soft, but not browned - about 5 minutes. <br/><br/>Add the garlic, ginger and diced tomato to the pan and cook about 5 minutes or until the tomatoes loose their shape and become less watery. <br/><br/>Finally, add the spinach and chillies. Sprinkle immediately with salt to help retain the bright green color. Once the greens begin to wilt, stir in the chickpeas and cook a minute or two longer. Taste for seasoning (chilli and salt), adjust if needed and serve.<br/><br/></div></body>
