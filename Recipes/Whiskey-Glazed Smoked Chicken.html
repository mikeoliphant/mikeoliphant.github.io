<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Whiskey-Glazed Smoked Chicken</div><br/><br/>I use a gas grill and a mixture of apple and alder wood chips. Early Times whisky and grade B maple syrup for the glaze. The resulting chicken has a golden, glossy skin with incredibly moist, highly flavored meat.  <br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The Brine:</div><br/>1 gallon (4 liters) water<br/>1 1/2 cups (350 grams) kosher salt<br/>1/2 cup (125 grams) sugar<br/>8 teaspoons (42 grams) pink salt<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The Glaze:</div><br/>1 cup (250 ml) bourbon<br/>1/2 cup (125 grams) maple sugar or 1/2 cup maple syrup<br/>1/4 packed cup (50 grams) dark brown sugar<br/>Pinch cayenne pepper<br/><br/><br/>1 (3-4 pound) chicken<br/><br/><br/>Mix the brine ingredients in a large (~12 quart) pot until all sugar and salts have dissolved.  Place the pot in the refrigerator until the brine is cold.<br/><br/>Rinse the chicken under cold water, and then place it into the brine.  The chicken should be fully submerged; use a plate to weigh it down if it tends to float.  Chill for about 18 hours.<br/><br/>Remove the chicken from the brine and rinse well under cold water. Pat dry with paper towels, place on a tray and refrigerate uncovered for at least 4 hours or up to a day.  This allows the salt brine to distribute more evenly and improves the skin's ability to accept the smoke flavor.<br/><br/>Mix the glaze ingredients in a small pan and bring to a low simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Continue cooking until the glaze becomes syrupy. The original recipe suggested arriving at a volume of 1 cup, however cooking longer to achieve a 1/2-cup volume results in a thicker glaze with more chance of sticking to your bird.  When ready, remove from heat and allow to cool.<br/><br/>Prepare your grill for hot smoking by lighting only one burner.  Put a wood chip smoker box filled with damp wood chips near the lit burner and bring to a smolder.  Place the chicken on a grill rack away from the lit burner and close the grill lid.  Maintain a temperature of about 200 degrees, replenishing wood chips as necessary to achieve a consistent smokiness.<br/><br/>After about 2 hours, brush some of the glaze all over the surface of the chicken.  Close the grill lid and continue smoking the bird until a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 160 degrees, about an hour to an hour-and-a-half longer.  <br/><br/>Remove the chicken from the grill and brush with more of the glaze.  Let rest at least 15 minutes before carving and serve warm now, or chilled later.<br/><br/></div></body>
