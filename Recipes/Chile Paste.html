<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Chile Paste</div><br/><br/>Makes about 1 cup.<br/><br/>This chile paste is perfect for adding a deep, but neutral heat to dishes. <br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Ingredients:</div><br/>1 1/2 ounces chile de arbol<br/>Water<br/><br/><br/>Destem the chiles and cut them in half, removing any seeds that shake out easily.<br/><br/>In a frying pan over medium high heat, toast the chiles while constantly stirring them around until they darken but do not burn (about 5 minutes). If your stove has an exhaust fan, you may want to use it.<br/><br/>Place the toasted chiles in a large bowl, discarding any seeds that fell out during the cooking process. Add enough hot water to just cover the chiles, and put a small plate on top of them to keep them submerged. Soak them for about a half hour.<br/><br/>Remove the chiles from the soaking liquid, and place them in a blender with enough of the soaking liquid to allow blending (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup).<br/><br/>Blend first on low power, and then on high until you have a smooth paste.<br/><br/></div></body>
