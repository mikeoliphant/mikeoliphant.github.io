<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Tamarind Dipping Sauce</div><br/><br/>Pan roasted garlic is an easy way to soften the garlic and mellow its flavor. Simply place whole, unpeeled garlic cloves in a dry frying pan at medium high heat. Cook, turning frequently for about ten minutes or until the skin is blackened in some places and the garlic gives when pushed.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Ingredients:</div><br/>1/4 cup tamarind paste<br/>1/2 cup hot water, divided<br/>1 teaspoon sugar<br/>1 tablespoon ketchup<br/>2-3 pan roasted garlic<br/>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>Red food coloring<br/><br/><br/>Place the tamarind paste in a small bowl and add 1/4 cup of hot water. Break up the paste with a spoon, then let sit for 5 minutes. Smash the paste in the water, then force through a fine mesh strainer, pushing as much of the dissolved portion through as you can. Return the leftover seeds and skin to the bowl,  add another 2-3 tablespoons hot water and let sit for another 5 minutes. Stir and strain again. You should end up with 3-4 tablespoons of smooth tamarind sauce.<br/><br/>Peel the garlic, sprinkle with the salt and use the side of a large knife to smash the garlic into a paste. Chop through the paste to make sure no large chunks remain, then add it to the tamarind sauce. Stir in the sugar, ketchup and enough food coloring to obtain a noticeable red color. Thin to your desired consistency with up to 3 tablespoons of cool water.<br/><br/></div></body>
