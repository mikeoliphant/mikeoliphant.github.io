<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Corn Chowder with Smoked Andouille</div><br/><br/>If your sausage is nicely smokey and your corn is very fresh and it'll turn out great. Nice with open-faced grilled cheese sandwiches (cave-aged gruyere on toasted ciabatta) along side.<br/><br/>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil<br/>1/2 small onion, finely diced<br/>1 celery stalk, finely diced<br/>1 cup milk<br/>1 cup chicken stock<br/>2-3 ears corn<br/>5 oz andouille sausage<br/><br/><br/>Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and celery; let sweat until just translucent. <br/><br/>Cut the kernals off the corn cobs. You should have about 2 1/2 cups of corn kernals. Break the cobs in half and use the back of a knife to scrap the corn juices from cobs into the sauce pan, then add the cobs to the pan.<br/><br/>Add the milk and chicken broth to the pan and bring to a low simmer. Add a couple pinches of salt. Simmer about 15 minutes. Remove and discard the corn cobs.<br/><br/>Add 1 1/2 cups of the corn kernals to the pan, then use an immersion blender to puree the soup. Cut the andouille into quarters lengthwise, then cut into 1/4-inch pieces. Add the sausage to the pan along with the remaining 1 cup corn. Simmer gently for about 5 minutes. Taste salt, adjust then serve.<br/><br/></div></body>
