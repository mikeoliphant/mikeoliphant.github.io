<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage and Fennel Ragu</div><br/><br/>Recipe copyright 2000, Mario Batali. <br/><br/>Note: One-half recipe of gnocchi makes about 30 gnocchi (shaped with teaspoons). Eight or nine is a good serving size. <br/>One-half recipe of Sausage and Fennel Ragu makes enough to coat a full batch of gnocchi. Make a half recipe and freeze the extra. <br/><br/>Cooking nots: Add double the quantiy of Mario Sauce to the Ragu. Simmer the sauce at least 60 minutes so that all the vegetables fully soften.<br/><br/>2 pounds italian sausage, removed from casing and crumbled<br/>1 tablespoon ground fennel seed, toasted and ground<br/>1 tablespoon red chile flakes<br/>1 red onion, finely chopped<br/>1 fennel bulb, finely chopped<br/>1 carrot, finely diced<br/>1 celery stalk, finely diced<br/>4 garlic cloves, sliced<br/>2 cups Mario Sauce (basic tomato sauce)<br/>Salt and pepper, to taste<br/>Ricotta gnocchi, recipe follows<br/>Pecorino Romano, grated<br/><br/><br/>In a heavy-bottomed pan, cook the sausage over high heat until it begins to brown in its own fat. Add half of the fennel seeds and chile flakes. Remove the sausage from the pan when cooked through and add the onions, fennel, carrots, celery and garlic. Cook the vegetables until they're well browned and return the sausage to the pan. Add the tomato sauce and remaining fennel seeds and chile flakes. Simmer 1/2 hour, until vegetables and sausage are very tender. Season well with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt. Gently slip as many gnocchi at a time as will float freely into a pot of boiling water, stirring gently with a wooden spoon as you do. Cook until the gnocchi rise to the surface, about 7 minutes. (Test 1 for doneness by cutting into the center; the gnocchi should be the same color and consistency all the way through.) Scoop them out with a wire skimmer as soon as they are cooked. Drain and add to the pan with the hot ragu, tossing gently 1 minute to coat. Top with Pecorino Romano and serve immediately.<br/><br/>1 1/2 pounds fresh goat-milk ricotta (or regular ricotta)<br/>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour, or as needed<br/>2 large eggs, beaten<br/>1 tablespoon chopped, fresh italian parsley<br/>1 teaspoon salt<br/>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br/>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br/><br/><br/>Place the ricotta in a fine sieve over a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight. In a medium-sized bowl, stir the drained ricotta, 1 cup of the flour, the eggs, parsley, salt, pepper and nutmeg together gently but thoroughly until a soft dough forms, adding a little more of the flour if the dough is sticky when poked. Forming the gnocchi: dip 2 tablespoons in cool water. Using 1 spoon, scoop up a heaping tablespoon of the ricotta mixture and use the other spoon to form it into a smooth, pointed oval. (Alternatively, you can roll the mixture into balls with well-floured hands, using about 2 tablespoons ricotta mixture for each ball.) Place the gnocchi on a baking sheet lined with a lightly-floured kitchen towel.<br/><br/></div></body>
