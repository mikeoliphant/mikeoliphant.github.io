<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Pig Heart di Lambusco</div><br/><br/>From a comment on MenuInProgress: "Your grilled heart sounds wonderful. I found a pig heart recipe online some time ago and we now use it for the first pig butchered each season: Contrary to what it says, it barely serves 4 & we double the quantity of potatoes."<br/>Mike and I found the potato salad to be overly mustardy. Also, we prefer a quick cooked heart rather than long cooked (long cooked is more gamey though)<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the heart:</div><br/>1 pig heart<br/>3 cups cold chicken stock<br/>1 cup red wine (we use lambrusco, an italian red sparkling they often serve with salumi, but you can substitute any drinkable red<br/>1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>1 celery stalk, roughly chopped<br/>1/2 red onion, roughly chopped<br/>2 garlic cloves, peeled<br/>1 bay leaf<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the marinade:</div><br/>1/2 onion, julienned<br/>1/2 cup quality extra virgin olive oil<br/>1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br/>1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley<br/>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br/><br/><br/>To cook the heart, bring all the ingredients to a simmer together on the stove for 2 1/2 hours. Let cool in the liquid in the refrigerator. Once completely cool, cut the heart in half and slice as thin as you can. Gently toss with marinade ingredients just to combine.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the potato salad:</div><br/>3 yukon potatoes<br/>1/2 cup quality extra virgin olive oil, we use dry creek, mcevoy, or da vero<br/>1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br/>2 tablespoons grain mustard, or more to taste<br/>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br/><br/><br/>Bring the potatoes, water, and some salt to a simmer, until just done, about 40 minutes. Let cool at room temperature. Once cool, cut into bite-size pieces. Toss with olive oil, vinegar, olive oil, grain mustard, salt and pepper. Adjust to taste.<br/>To plate: In a shallow bowl, spoon some of the potato salad, top with the marinated pig heart and garnish with more extra virgin oil. The marinated pig heart will hold for several days in the refrigerator.<br/><br/></div></body>
