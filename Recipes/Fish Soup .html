<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Fish Soup </div><br/><br/>Despite the long list of ingredients, this Italian-style fish soup is actually very quick and easy. Use the freshest fish you can find, and whatever veggies are in the fridge.<br/><br/>4 cups vegetable stock or  fish stock<br/>2-4 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed<br/>1 medium carrot<br/>1 medium zucchini<br/>1 medium onion<br/>1/2 red bell pepper<br/>2 sticks celery stalk<br/>1 (14 ounce) can plum tomatoes (whole or chopped)<br/>Splash olive oil<br/>1 garlic clove, crushed<br/>1 teaspoon oregano<br/>1/2 teaspoon basil<br/>Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)<br/>Salt and pepper<br/>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)<br/>1 pound firm white-fleshed fish, cut in 1-inch pieces<br/>1/4 pound cleaned squid, cut in 1/2-inch pieces (optional)<br/><br/><br/>Put stock and potatoes into a medium to large pot and simmer until the potatoes are just beginning to get tender (about 10 minutes).<br/><br/>Chop the rest of the fresh veggies into fairly uniform bite-sized pieces (the ones given are just an example -  experiment!). <br/><br/>Add the chopped veggies, the canned tomato (mush it, if you used whole canned tomatoes), oregano, basil, olive oil, and garlic to the pot. Simmer until the veggies are tender (about 5minutes).<br/><br/>Add the fish, cilantro, crushed red pepper (if you want a bit of spice), and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer gently about 5 minutes or until the fish is cooked through.<br/><br/>Eat with fresh country style bread (for dipping - yum!) <br/><br/></div></body>
