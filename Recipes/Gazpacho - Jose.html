<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Gazpacho - Jose</div><br/><br/>Makes 4 half-cup servings.  While this soup can be made in a food processor, a blender does a better job of creating a smooth puree and incorporating the oil for a more pleasing texture.  <br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the soup:</div><br/>10 ounces ripe tomatoes (about 3 plum tomatoes)<br/>5 ounces cucumbers, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1/2 cucumber)<br/>2 ounces green bell pepper (about 1/4 bell pepper)<br/>1/2 garlic clove<br/>2 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar<br/>2 tablespoons water<br/>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br/>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the garnish:</div><br/>2 ripe plum tomatoes<br/>12 small cherry tomatoes<br/>1 small zebra striped green tomato (optional)<br/>1/2 cucumber, peeled<br/>2 pearl onions, thinly sliced into rings<br/>1 teaspoon red wine vinegar<br/>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil<br/><br/><br/>Cut the tomatoes and green bell pepper into large chunks -- discarding the cores -- and place into a blender.  Remove some of the seeds from the cucumber, then chop it into large pieces and add it to the blender.  Follow with the garlic, vinegar, and water, then puree in the blender until fairly smooth.  Add the olive oil and salt, then puree again.  The liquid will turn pinkish rather than red and should thicken somewhat.  Taste and add additional salt or vinegar if desired.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Prepare the garnishes as follows.  <br/>Cut a slice off the top and bottom of each plum tomato, then cut in half lengthwise and remove the seeds.  Using a sharp knife, remove the tomato skins by slicing horizontally, keeping the blade next to the skin and cutting board. Square up the edges of the tomato flesh and slice into strips. <br/><br/>Cut the cherry tomatoes into halves, and slice the zebra striped tomato into thin disks. <br/><br/>Remove the cucumber seeds and cut the flesh into evenly sized 3/8-inch cubes.  Drizzle with vinegar and chill until ready to serve.<br/><br/>Just before serving, give the gazpacho a quick stir or pulse of the blender.  Put a scant half-cup of soup into each of four 4-oz shallow ramekins.  Arrange a few strips of tomato flesh, 6 or 7 cucumber cubes, 6 cherry tomato halves, 1 or 2 slices of the zebra striped tomato and a few onion rings in each serving.  Drizzle with olive oil and serve immediately.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
