We tried a version with some ancho replacing some of the ceyanne.<br/><br/>as printed in: http://blogs.nashvillescene.com/bites/2008/07/bites_exclusive_winning_hot_ch.php<br/><br/>Award-Winning Hot Chicken Recipe<br/>By Justin Jones, food adventurer and breaker of hearts<br/><br/>The Paste (enough for one or two chicken breasts):<br/>1 tbsp plus 2 tsp lard<br/>3 tbsp cayenne<br/>3 pinches sugar<br/>3/8 teaspoon salt<br/>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br/><br/>Other Ingredients:<br/>Self-rising flour, chicken, white bread, and pickles<br/><br/><br/>All the seasoning is in the paste; dredge the chicken in plain self-rising flour. Fry it.<br/><br/>Mix all of the ingredients for the paste (microwaving the lard for about 30 seconds will make this easier). Apply it evenly and liberally to the fried chicken using either a basting brush or your latex glove-protected hands. Note: I generally use about a teaspoonful of paste for each side of a chicken breast. This method is the only way I know to get the orange, grease-soaked white bread that is the hallmark of all true hot chicken.<br/><br/>When you've covered the top half, flip it over onto a piece of white bread and finish the job. Enjoy. <br/><br/></div></body>
