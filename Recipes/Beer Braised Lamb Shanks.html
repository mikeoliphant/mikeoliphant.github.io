<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Beer Braised Lamb Shanks</div><br/><br/>Beer braising creates a perfectly cooked lamb shank -- meat that comes off of the bone easily, but still with some structure left and with that lovely stickiness that comes from collagen breaking down. The sauce is a bright, burnished orange with great flavor. The hint of bitterness from the hops in the beer adds an intriguing note. (We used IPA #2 - homebrew.)<br/><br/>4 (3/4 pound) lamb shanks<br/>salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste<br/>2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br/>3 small onions, quartered<br/>2 large carrots, peeled and chopped<br/>1 large tomato, cored and finely diced<br/>2 garlic cloves, minced<br/>1 (22 ounce) bomber malty beer<br/>Approx. 1 cup beef stock<br/><br/><br/>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Heat oil over medium high in a large dutch oven. Season the lamb shanks with salt and pepper, then sear in the hot pan until well browned on all sides, 10-15 minutes total. Remove shanks from pan and set aside in a bowl.<br/><br/>Brown the onions and carrots in the same pan, stirring occasionally. When lightly browned (about 5 to 7 minutes), reduce heat to medium and add the tomato and garlic. Stir and cook about 2 minutes. Add one third of the beer then scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to incorporate any brown bits into the sauce. Add the remaining beer and bring to a boil. <br/><br/>Simmer the beer and vegetables for a couple minutes, then nestle the shanks into the pot, adding any juices from the bowl. Add enough beef stock to immerse about 3/4 of the shanks. Put the lid on the dutch oven and place in the preheated oven for an hour to an hour-and-fifteen minutes. The shanks are done when the meat pulls easily from the bone and is very tender. Remove shanks from the pot and skim excess fat from the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper, return the shanks to the beer broth and serve.<br/><br/><br/></div></body>
