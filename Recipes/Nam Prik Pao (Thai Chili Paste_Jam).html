<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Nam Prik Pao (Thai Chili Paste/Jam)</div><br/><br/>Puya chiles are traditional and make a nice version. Have also used a mix of New Mexican/Guajillo (0.8 oz), Puya (0.2 oz) and Japone (0.1 oz) with success.<br/><br/>We use it in Thai Stir-fried Eggplant with Pork and we add it to Pad Thai sauce.<br/><br/>1 ounce dried chile, seeded (seeds reserved)<br/>2 g reserved seeds<br/>1 1/2 ounces garlic (10 cloves)<br/>3 1/2-4 ounces (4 heads) shallots<br/>1/2 ounce (2 tablespoons) dried shrimp<br/>1/3 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>1 1/2 ounces (3 tablespoons) palm sugar<br/>1/2 ounce (2-3 tablespoons) tamarind paste<br/>1 tablespoon fish sauce<br/>1/4 teaspoon shrimp sauce/paste<br/><br/><br/>Toast the dried chilies in a dry saute pan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until they are charred in some spots and smell smoky. Remove from pan and set aside. In the same pan, add garlic and shallots and toast, stirring constantly, until they are charred. Remove from pan.<br/><br/>In a coffee grinder, grind dried chilies into a powder. Add dried shrimp and grind until fine. (You may need to do 2 or 3 batches.)<br/><br/>In a blender, add all ingredients and grind into a fine paste. <br/><br/>Transfer the chili paste into a pot or a wok. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for about 10-12 minutes to cook the herbs and to thicken the paste to a desired consistency. If you are making a large batch, it will take more time to cook.<br/><br/>Store in a glass jar, and it'll keep in the fridge for a few months or in the freezer indefinitely. <br/><br/></div></body>
