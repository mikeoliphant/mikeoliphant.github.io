<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Mandarin Pancakes</div><br/><br/><br/><br/>2 cups all-purpose flour, unsifted<br/>3/4 cup boiling water<br/>Approx. 2 tablespoons sesame oil or  salad oil<br/><br/><br/>Place the flour into a bowl and pour in the boiling water. Mix with a fork or chopsticks until it begins to hold together as a dough, then turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead for about 5 minutes. The dough will become soft, satiny and easy to work with. Place in a plastic bag and let rest for 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Using your hands, roll the dough into a dowel about a foot long. Cut into 12 equal sized pieces, and set aside, covered.<br/><br/>Heat an ungreased frying pan over medium-high heat.<br/><br/>To make a pair of pancakes, cut a piece of dough exactly in half. Shape each half into a ball and flatten somewhat. With a rolling pin, roll both balls into 3-inch rounds. Brush the entire surface of one round with a little sesame oil, then place the second round on top. Press together, then roll out into a 6 or 7-inch pancake.<br/><br/>Cook the pancake-pair in the hot, dry frying pan, turning every 15 seconds, until the cake is poofy with air pockets and the surface is dry and parchment like (but do not overcook or they will lose their elasticity).<br/><br/>Remove from the pan and gently pull the two halves apart. Stack on a plate and keep covered while you repeat the process for the remaining pancakes.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
