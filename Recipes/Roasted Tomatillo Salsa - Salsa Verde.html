<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Roasted Tomatillo Salsa - Salsa Verde</div><br/><br/>Tomatillo Salsa can be made with raw or roasted ingredients.  The raw version is herby and fresh, but roasting brings out an earthy richness with pungent and tangy notes that I find very appealing.<br/>Makes about 2 cups.<br/><br/>1 pound (10 to 12 medium) tomatillos, husked and rinsed<br/>3 fresh hot green chiles (such as jalapeno or serrano)<br/>10-12 sprigs fresh cilantro, roughly chopped (thick stems removed)<br/>1/2 cup finely chopped white onion<br/>Kosher salt<br/><br/><br/>Preheat the broiler.  Place the tomatillos and chiles on a baking sheet 4 inches below the hot broiler and roast about 5 minutes or until darkly roasted and blackened in spots.  Flip them over and roast another 4 to 5 minutes.  Tomatillos should be splotchy-black and softened. Cool slightly, then transfer tomatillos, 2 chiles and any juices to a blender or food processor.  Add cilantro, 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 teaspoon salt then blend to a coarse puree.  Taste.  For more heat, add the extra chile and blend again. Scrape salsa into a small bowl. Add the onion and stir.  Taste and adjust seasoning if desired.<br/><br/></div></body>
