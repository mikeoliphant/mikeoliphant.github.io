<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Radish Cake (Turnip Cake)</div><br/><br/>Still a work in progress. Original recipe was by volume. Five spice: 1 part star anise, 1 part cinnamon, 2 parts fennel, 1/3 part cloves, and 1/2 part sichuan pepper or ginger. <br/><br/>14-15 ounces daikon radishes, shredded<br/>2 1/2-3 ounces shallots, chopped<br/>2 tablespoons oil<br/>1 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>1 teaspoon white pepper<br/>1 teaspoon soy sauce<br/>1/4 teaspoon five spice powder<br/>95-110 grams rice flour<br/>7 ounces cold water, plus more for rice flour slurry<br/><br/><br/>Saute shallot in oil on medium high heat for about 2 minutes or until translucent and beginning to caramelize. Add the turnip, salt, white pepper, soy sauce and spices. Stir and cook for one minute. Stir in cold water. Turn heat down to medium low and cook 8-10 minutes or until turnip is soft. <br/><br/>Combine rice flour and cold water (how much?? original recipe says 1 c rice flour and 1 c water). Stir into the turnip mixture and remove from heat. Stir until thickened.<br/><br/>Line a loaf pan wiht parchment paper and brush with sesame oil. Dump in the turnip cake batter and smooth the top with a spatula. Steam the loaf over high heat for 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean (mine took longer). Chill in the refrigerator overnight.<br/><br/>Remove from pan and slice into thick pieces. Pan fry in oil until golden brown and crispy. Serve warm with soy sauce, vinegar and chile oil.<br/><br/></div></body>
