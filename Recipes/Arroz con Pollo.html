<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Arroz con Pollo</div><br/><br/>I made half the recipe using 4 whole thighs and it was plenty for two with at least the same amount leftover. I pounded the garlic with about 3/4 kosher salt and added about a tablespoon of oil to the spice mixture before rubbing it on the chicken. I then used about 2 tablespoons oil for browning the chicken, but removed close to that amount as they cooked. I used red and yellow bell peppers (mixed) and Pacifico lager. I'd probably use just a little less rice and broth next time (I went with the higher end of broth/stock).<br/><br/>3 pounds chicken, assorted pieces<br/>1 tablespoon achiote powder<br/>1 tablespoon ground cumin<br/>1/2 tablespoon ground coriander<br/>10 garlic cloves, crushed<br/>2-3 tablespoons oil or  butter<br/>1 white onion, diced, about 2 cups<br/>2 celery stalks, finely diced<br/>4 roma tomatoes, peeled and diced<br/>1 bell pepper, diced<br/>1 cup beer or white wine<br/>1 to 1 ½ cup water or broth<br/>2 cups rice<br/>2 medium carrots, diced<br/>1 cup peas, fresh or frozen<br/>3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro<br/>Salt and pepper<br/><br/><br/>1. Mix the crushed garlic, achiote, cumin, coriander and salt together.<br/>2. Rub the garlic seasoning on the chicken pieces.<br/>3. Heat the oil or butter on medium high heat in large sauté pan, add the chicken pieces (skin side down) and cook until browned on each side.<br/>4. Add the diced onions, tomatoes, bell pepper, and celery, mix well and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br/>5. Add 1 cup of beer or white wine, cook for about 20-25 minutes over medium heat until the liquid is reduced by half, stir frequently.<br/>6. Add the broth or water, rice, peas and carrots, mix well.<br/>7. Cover and cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes.<br/>8. Reduce the heat to low and cook for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the rice is tender but still slightly firm.<br/>9. Stir in the chopped cilantro and serve with ripe fried plantains, a small salad, pickled onions, avocado slices, and hot sauce on the side.<br/><br/></div></body>
