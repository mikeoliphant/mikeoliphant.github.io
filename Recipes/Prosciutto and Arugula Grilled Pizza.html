<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Prosciutto and Arugula Grilled Pizza</div><br/><br/>Mmmm, pizza....  While a wood or charcoal heated grill would be more traditional and provide a nice smoky flavor, a gas grill is convenient and easier to control.  We heat up both sides to get it hot, hot, hot, but then turn off one side for perfect indirect cooking.  The ingredient list is enough for 1/2 a batch of prepared dough.  Cook the remaining dough in the same manner for a second pizza, but use our Onion and Bell Pepper Grilled Pizza recipe or personalize it with your own toppings.<br/><br/>Pizza dough<br/>1 (8 ounce) red onion<br/>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for brushing the dough<br/>2 ounces mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced<br/>2-3 thin prosciutto slices<br/>1 handful baby arugula<br/>Parmigiano reggiano<br/>Kosher salt<br/><br/><br/>Remove the pizza dough from the refrigerator at least 45 minutes prior to grilling.  On a lightly floured surface, cut the dough into two equal sized pieces and shape each into a ball.  (Return the second ball to the refrigerator if only making this pizza.) Let rest 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Halve the onion, then cut it into 1/4-inch slices.  Heat a saute pan over medium heat.  Add the 2 tablespoons olive oil, onion and a pinch of salt.  Cook, stirring occasionally until the onion is soft and lightly browned, about 30 minutes.  Place the cooked onion into a bowl and set aside. <br/><br/>After the dough has rested 20 minutes, shape each ball into a rough, somewhat thick disk, 4 or 5 inches across.  Let rest another 10-15 minutes.  Meanwhile, tear the prosciutto into irregular strips about 2 or 3 inches long.  Set aside.  Shave several strips of parmagiano reggiano into a bowl and set aside.<br/><br/>Make sure the barbeque grill is very hot by turning all burners on high 15 minutes ahead of time, and keep the lid closed.  (Do this at the same time that you shape the dough into thick disks.)  <br/><br/>Load a tray with a small bowl of olive oil, a pastry brush, metal tongs, the cooked onions, sliced mozzarella, proscuitto strips, arugula and parmagiano shavings.  Take out to the bbq grill.  <br/><br/>When ready to grill, pick up a disk of dough and stretch it gently and evenly into a round about 8 or 9 inches across.  Start by stretching the edges with your finger tips, then place it on the backs of your hands to stretch with your fists.  Take it out to the grill, draped over the back of one hand.  With the other hand, paint  the dough with a thin layer of olive oil.  Open the grill's lid and turn the heat off on one side.  Carefully place the dough on the grill, oil side down, away from the flame.  Close the lid.  After 5 minutes, check the dough.  It should begin to puff and should not stick to the grate.  Rotate it one quarter-turn and close the lid again.  <br/><br/>After another 5 minutes, open the lid and turn on all burners again.  Brush the dough with olive oil and pat down any very large bubbles.  Using the tongs, flip the dough onto the hotter side of the grill -- then turn off the heat under the dough (you want grill marks, but not a burnt crust!).  Spread the onions over the crust and arrange the mozzarella around the pizza.  Close the lid for about 8 minutes.  At this point, the pizza should be nearly cooked.  Scatter the proscuitto, arugula and parmigiano over the pizza, then close the lid for another 2 minutes.  <br/><br/>Remove the pizza by sliding it onto a small cutting board.  Let rest 3-5 minutes, then cut into wedges with a sharp knife.  Serve hot or at room temperature.  (And don't forget to turn off the grill.) <br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Preparing the grill:</div><br/>When the bbq is hot and just before it's time to cook, make sure the grill grates are quite clean (scrub with a metal brush if necessary) and then quickly oil the grates.  I normally take a small dish of canola oil and grab a wadded-up paper towel with metal tongs out to the grill.  Dip the paper into the oil and quickly rub it over the grates.  Rotate the towel and dip again as needed.  Be careful of the hot oil!<br/><br/></div></body>
