<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Mushroom and Wine Pilaff </div><br/><br/>This pilaff has a nice, mild taste, and is great with fish (like salmon). For the wine, you can use the cheapest white that you will be happy drinking the rest of. One and a half cups of mushrooms looks like a ton, but they cook down a lot. Use more or less depending on just how mushroomy you feel on a particular day.<br/><br/>1/2 medium onion, chopped small<br/>1 1/2 cups chopped dried mushrooms (small cubes)<br/>1 tablespoon olive oil<br/>1/4 teaspoon thyme sprigs<br/>1/4 teaspoon sage<br/>Chicken stock cube (for 1 cup)<br/>1 1/2 cups basmati rice or other long-grained rice<br/>3/4 cup white wine<br/><br/><br/>Sauté onions and mushrooms in olive oil for about 5 minutes or until mostly soft. Add the stock cube and herbs, mix, and remove from heat.<br/><br/>In a medium saucepan, rinse the rice three times with cold tap water and drain. Add the wine to the rice, then top up with cold water (about 1/3 cup) so that the liquid is about 1 cm above the level of the rice. Stir the sautéed mixture into the rice, and rinse the pan with a little of the rice liquid to get all the good stuff.<br/><br/>Cover with a lid and bring to boiling. Be sure to get a rolling boil, then move the pan to another burner set at very low heat. Cook gently (without peeking) for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff and serve.<br/><br/></div></body>
