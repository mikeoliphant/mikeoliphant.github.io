<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Thai Stir-fried Eggplant with Pork</div><br/><br/>We often serve a soft centered Thai boiled egg along side.<br/>We used homemade Nam Prik Pao.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Sauce:</div><br/>2 tablespoons Nam Prik Pao<br/>1 tablespoon soy sauce<br/>2 teaspoons fish sauce<br/>2 teaspoons oyster sauce<br/>2 tablespoons water<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The Rest:</div><br/>250 g Chinese or Japance eggplant<br/>4 garlic cloves<br/>3-4 thai chilies, seeded (red if possible)<br/>200 grams ground pork (or chicken)<br/>1 cup thai basil leaves<br/><br/><br/>Combine all sauce ingredients together and whisk until the chili paste is dissolved.<br/><br/>Pound chilies and garlic in a mortar and pestle until there are no more big chunks (but not a fine paste). <br/>Slice the eggplant on a bias about 0.5-inch thick, then halve each round.<br/><br/>In a large, flat skillet, add just enough oil to coat the bottom, then heat until quite hot but not smoking. Add the eggplant in one layer (you may need to do this in batches) and let sear over medium high heat, undisturbed, until the bottom side is browned. Flip and cook the other side until it is browned as well. The pieces from the bottom of the eggplant will cook faster, so you will need to remove those first. Transfer into a bowl and set aside.<br/><br/>In a wok, add a little bit of oil and the pounded garlic and chili mixture. Saute for about 1 minute over medium heat just until the garlic starts to brown. Add ground meat and cook until 80% done. Add the eggplant and the sauce, then keep tossing for about 2-3 minutes until the eggplant is fully cooked but not mushy. Add the basil, turn off the heat, then toss for 30 more seconds using the residual heat to wilt the basil.<br/><br/>Serve with rice. Enjoy!<br/><br/></div></body>
