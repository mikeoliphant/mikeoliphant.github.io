<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Sun God Chicken</div><br/><br/>This recipe was an attempt to recreate a dish that Mike liked at the UCSD food court back in the early 90's.<br/><br/>Updated 11/15/08<br/>We are in the process of modifying this recipe. Still had too much sauce, but proportions were improved (and you may need the extra sauce if doing the deep fry).<br/><br/>I need to check -- Keep note of vinegar acidity: I used a mix of "adjusted to 4.3%" and "above 4.5%" (higher is nicer I think). <br/><br/>Use more onion than bell pepper. <br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the cooking sauce:</div><br/>3 tablespoons sugar<br/>1/3 cup rice wine vinegar<br/>2 tablespoons dark soy sauce<br/>1/3 cup unsalted chicken stock<br/>1 tablespoon cornstarch<br/>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>1/2 teaspoon chili paste (sambal oelek)<br/>1/2 teaspoon hot red chile flakes<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the stir-fry:</div><br/>3-4 boneless skinless chicken thighs or 1 breast, cut into 1/2 to 1-inch pieces (about 12 ounces)<br/>2 tablespoons canola oil<br/>2 garlic cloves, minced<br/>2/3 red bell pepper, cut into strips<br/>1 1/2 onions, cut into strips<br/>10 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces, white and green parts separated<br/><br/><br/>Option 1: Coat the chicken pieces in the batter and deep fry until golden. Set aside in a warm place.<br/>Option 2: Coat the chicken pieces in the marinade and let sit 15 minutes. <br/><br/>Heat a wok over high heat; when hot, add the oil and garlic. Stir-fry the chicken pieces for 2 minutes (for Option 2), then add bell pepper strips and cook an additional 2 minutes. Add onion strips, and the whites of the green onion. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp tender. (Add deep fried chicken now for Option 1).<br/><br/>Pour the cooking sauce over the stir-fry, mix well and cook about 60 seconds to thicken. Remove from heat and stir in the green parts of the green onion.<br/><br/>Serve over hot cooked short grained rice and garnish with extra green onion slivers.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the batter (Option 1):</div><br/>1 egg<br/>1/3 cup flour<br/>1/4 teaspoon salt<br/>1 tablespoon water<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">For the marinade (Option 2):</div><br/>1 small garlic clove, minced<br/>1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar<br/>2 teaspoons soy sauce<br/>1/4 teaspoon hot red chile flakes<br/>1/2 teaspoon canola oil<br/><br/><br/></div></body>
