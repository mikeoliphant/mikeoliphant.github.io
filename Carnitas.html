<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Carnitas</div><br/><br/><br/><br/>2 1/2 pounds country style pork ribs<br/>1 cup water<br/>fresh orange juice from 1/2 large fruit<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice<br/>2 teaspoons ground cumin<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons mexican oregano<br/>2 teaspoons kosher salt<br/>2 bay leaves<br/>1 teaspoon garlic powder<br/>4 smashed garlic cloves<br/>3/4 onion cut into wedges<br/>1 teaspoon black pepper<br/><br/><br/>Trim most of the fat from the pork ribs. Put everything (including pork fat) into a dutch oven and mix gently. Simmer about 2.5 hours turning the ribs occasionally. Remove ribs from pot and place on a sheet pan. Defat the sauce (reserve the fat) and boil to reduce somewhat. <br/>When ready to eat, anoint the ribs with some of the reserved fat and carefully broil to warm and brown the meat. Turn as needed. <br/>Serve with all the sides: Guacamole, fresh pico de gallo salsa, refried beans, red rice, seasoned shredded cabbage (salt and lime), hot sauce and warm corn tortillas.  <br/><br/></div></body>
