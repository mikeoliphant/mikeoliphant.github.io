<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Chile-Lime Chicken</div><br/><br/>If you can only find a 5 pound or larger bird, remove one of the breasts and save for another use. We've used red seranos, jalapenos, cayenne and Holland chillies. Seranos and Holland are usually hotter than Jalapenos.<br/><br/>1 whole chicken, about 4 1/2 pounds<br/>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided<br/>3 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br/>1/4 cup soy sauce<br/>4-5 whole limes<br/>4-6 fresh, hot red chillies<br/>1/4 cup sugar<br/>Approx. 1/4 cup canola oil, for frying<br/><br/><br/>Use a cleaver, kitchen shears or heavy knife to cut the chicken into small pieces (ie: breasts in 4-5 pieces each, wings split, thighs and legs in half). Leave the skin on. <br/><br/>In a large bowl, mix 1 Â½ teaspoon salt, the soy and the black pepper. Coat the chicken pieces evenly in the mixture and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (you can do this in the morning, and let it marinate all day in the fridge). <br/><br/>Squeeze the juice from the limes -- you should get 2/3 to 3/4 cups juice. Chop the chillies into smallish pieces. Put the chillies, a teaspoon of salt, and the sugar into the lime juice, then use a hand blender or food processor to chop the chillies finely. Taste the sauce and add additional sugar or salt if needed. <br/><br/>Heat the oil to medium high in a fry pan. Without crowding, place the chicken pieces into the pan and fry until golden brown and cooked through, turning as needed (15-20 minutes). Remove cooked pieces and keep warm while cooking the rest. <br/><br/>Serve the chicken family-style and provide each diner with a small bowl of dipping sauce and a second bowl of plain short-grained rice.<br/><br/>NOTE: Beware of your fingers after dinner -  the spiciness may linger... <br/><br/></div></body>
