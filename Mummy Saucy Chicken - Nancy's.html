<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Mummy Saucy Chicken - Nancy's</div><br/><br/>The combination of lime juice, chilli and sugar gives this dish a delicious tangy, fresh taste. <br/><br/>1 (approx. 2 1/2 pound) small chicken<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br/>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce<br/>1 teaspoon black pepper<br/>4 limes<br/>5 fresh red chiles (the long, skinny kind)<br/>Approx. 1/4 cup oil<br/>[sugar]<br/><br/><br/>Cut the chicken into small pieces (ie: breasts in 3-4 pieces each, wings and thighs in half, legs). Leave the skin on. <br/><br/>In a large bowl, mix Â½ teaspoon salt, the soy and the black pepper. Toss the chicken pieces in the mixture and leave to marinade for 2 hours or more (you can do this in the morning, and let it marinade all day in the fridge). <br/><br/>Squeeze the juice from the limes. <br/><br/>Chop the chillies into quarters and blend them with the lime juice, a teaspoon of salt, and the sugar. If you do not have a blender, chop the chillies as well as possible, and mix them with the other ingredients. <br/><br/>Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken pieces until golden brown (about 15 minutes). Remove from the pan and transfer to a serving plate. <br/><br/>Pour the chili-lime mixture on top of the chicken and EAT! <br/><br/>NOTE: Beware of your fingers after dinner -  the spiciness may linger... <br/><br/></div></body>
