<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Taco Shop Hot Sauce</div><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Ingredients:</div><br/>2 (approx. 8 ounce) tomatoes<br/>4 garlic cloves (skin on)<br/>Small handful (approx. 1/4 ounce) dried chile de arbol<br/>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br/>2 pinches mexican oregano<br/>1 teaspoon salt<br/><br/><br/>Use your fingers to break off the chile stems and break larger chiles into smaller pieces. Get out as many chile seeds as you can.<br/><br/>In a small frying pan over medium high heat, toast the chiles while constantly stirring them around until they darken but do not burn (about <br/>5 minutes). If your stove has an exhaust fan, you may want to use it.<br/><br/>Place the toasted chiles in a large bowl, discarding any seeds that fell out during the cooking process. Microwave a cup of water for 2 minutes and pour it over the chiles. Place a small plate on top of the chiles to keep them submerged. Soak for about twenty minutes.<br/><br/>Score both the tops and bottoms of the tomatoes with an "X" to allow the skin to peel away easily.<br/><br/>Put the tomatoes and garlic on a sheet pan and put them in the oven on broil until the garlic softens and the tomato skin begins to blister (5-10 minutes). You may need to take the garlic out before the tomatoes.<br/><br/>After cooling for a few minutes until you can safely handle them, peel the skin off of both the tomatoes and garlic. Remove any hard center bits from the tomatoes.<br/><br/>Put the chiles and the garlic in a blender, along with about 1/4 cup of the chile soaking liquid and blend until it forms a smooth paste.<br/><br/>Add the tomato and vinegar and blend until everything is well mixed.<br/><br/>You may need to add more soaking liquid to reach the consistency you want. The amount of water will very greatly depending on how juicy your tomatoes are.<br/><br/>Add oregano and salt to taste, giving a quick blend to mix.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
