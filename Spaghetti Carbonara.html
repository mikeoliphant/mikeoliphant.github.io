<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Spaghetti Carbonara</div><br/><br/>Version 2. Combined Mario and Marcella. (Better!) <br/>Serves 2. Weigh cheese. Consider using less cheese and/or oil (March, 2011).<br/>Nov. 2011: 3/8 oz of each cheese<br/><br/>3-4 ounces Pancetta<br/>4-6 ounces spaghetti<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br/>2 whole garlic cloves<br/>1/4 cup grated parmigiano reggiano<br/>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano<br/>2 large eggs, separated<br/>Italian parsley<br/>Freshly ground black pepper<br/><br/><br/>Cut the pancetta into lardons about 1/4 inch wide and 3/4 inch long. Lightly smash the garlic cloves with the side of a knife, just enough to split them.<br/>Cook the spagetti in boiling salted water (3qts + 1 T). At the same time, heat the olive oil and garlic in a large saute pan. Cook at medium high until the garlic is golden, then remove and discard it. Lower the heat to medium, add the pancetta and cook until it has lost a fair amount of its fat and is somewhat crispy. Remove from heat.<br/>Once the spaghetti is just al dente, scoop out and keep some of the pasta water, then drain the pasta. Return the pan to the heat and add 2 tablespoons of the pasta water, swirl around then add the spaghetti and heat it for 60 seconds, tossing frequently to coat it well in the oil. Remove from the heat. Stir together the egg whites and most of each cheese, then stir them through the pasta along with some pepper and fresh parsley. <br/>Divide the pasta in two bowls, swirling to create a well in the center of each. Drop an egg yolk into each well, scatter the extra cheese over the pasta and serve. Advise each diner to stir the yolk through the pasta at the table to complete the sauce.<br/><br/></div></body>
