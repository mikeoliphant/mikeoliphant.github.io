<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Hot Smoked Chicken</div><br/><br/>Season the bird either the night before or the morning of smoking. To butterfly your chicken, simply use some kitchen shears to cut down each side of the back bone and remove it. Then turn the bird over and press on the breast bone to flatten it.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Ingredients:</div><br/>1 4-5 pound Chicken, butterflied<br/>2-3 tablespoons Spicy Chicken Rub<br/>Kosher salt<br/>Smoke woods such as hickory, pecan, alder or mesquite<br/><br/><br/>Sprinkle kosher salt evenly over the bird, on all sides (use about 1/2 teaspoon per pound). Lay the bird on a tray, skin side down and sprinkle with some of the spice rub. Turn the bird over, skin side up and sprinkle a generous portion of spice rub evenly on the skin. Store the chicken in the refrigerator, uncovered until ready to smoke.<br/><br/>Heat the smoker to about 300°F, add smoke wood to the fire, and place bird on the grill (use an empty water pan covered with foil as a drip tray). Smoke at 300-330°F for 60-75 minutes or until the internal temperature of the breast reaches about 160-163°F. Remove from smoker and let rest 15 minutes before carving.<br/><br/></div></body>
