Add the chicken to the marinade and stir to coat. Add 1/2 teaspoon oil, stir, and set aside for about 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Slice the fungus into 1/4 inch strips, discarding the hard parts.  Slice onion into half-inch strips.  Slice the green top of the bok choy into half-inch strips crossways and do the same for the white bottom part, leaving a center piece of green and white about 3 inches long.  Slice the center pieces longways into 2 or 3 half-inch strips.  Put fungus, onion and bok choy into a bowl and set aside.<br/><br/>Heat a wok over high heat and add the 1 tablespoon of oil.

Stir-fry 2-3 minutes longer, until the vegetables are crisp tender and all the cooked bits on the bottom of the pan have been incorporated into the sauce.<br/><br/>Return the chicken to the pan. Stir the cooking sauce and pour it into the pan. Cook, stirring until sauce bubbles and thickens, 1-2 minutes.<br/><br/>Serve over plain, short-grained rice. <br/><br/></div></body>
