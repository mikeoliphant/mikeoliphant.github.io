<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Black Lentil and Sausage Stew</div><br/><br/>I usually make 1/2 a recipe for 2 dinners and 2 lunch sized portions. Original recipe used frozen corn, but I normally use fresh corn, cut off the cob (about 1 ear for a half-recipe). As an alternative to Italian sausage, smoked chicken sausage or other types can be used with good success.<br/><br/>1 1/2 cups black lentils<br/>1 1/4 pound sweet Italian sausages<br/>8 ounces sweet corn<br/>4 stalks celery, chopped<br/>1 medium onion, chopped<br/>5 1/2 cups water<br/>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>Black pepper<br/><br/><br/>Pick through the lentils, rinse if desired. Remove the sausages from their casings and break into bite sized lumps. Add to a medium-hot dutch oven, and cook until lightly browned. Add the celery and onion, stir through and cook 3-5 minutes or until softened. <br/><br/>Pour in the water and lentils. Stir through, cover and simmer about 45 minutes. Add the corn, salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered another 15 minutes or untill lentils are tender and desired consistency has been reached. Taste for seasoning. Serve hot with crusty bread.<br/><br/></div></body>
