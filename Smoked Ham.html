<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Smoked Ham</div><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Holidays 2013-14:</div><br/>Started on Christmas, ended on New Year's Day. <br/>9.5 pound pork picnic shoulder roast. Approx 5% salt brine. Soaked at 40 degrees for 5 days; dried in fridge for 2 days. Smoked with apple an pecan.<br/>The brine: Boiled part of the solution two minutes to soften the spices; added water to 10 liters and cooled to 40 degrees F before adding the pork.<br/>The smoke: The ham was smoked with apple and pecan woods, for about 7 hours. The smoker was kept at about 180 degrees for the first couple hours, then up to 215 for the next four hours and finished at 240 degrees the last hour, until the meat reached an internal temperature of 155 degrees. (Full water pan, skin side up.)<br/>Result: very good. Some parts were not fully brined; perhaps do some of the injection into artery next time? Brine for 5 days was not too salty at all.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Brine:</div><br/>10 liters water<br/>500 grams kosher salt (diamond)<br/>100 grams (approx. 1/3 cup) pink salt<br/>75 grams sugar<br/>75 grams brown sugar<br/>1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br/>2 teaspoons coriander seeds<br/>1 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds<br/><br/><br/></div></body>
