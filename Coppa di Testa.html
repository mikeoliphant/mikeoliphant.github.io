<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Coppa di Testa</div><br/><br/>A 16 quart pot is *just* big enough. Use an aggressive amount of salt, especially if you intend to eat this cold since flavors are muted at cooler temperatures. We found it was easier to slice using a serrated bread knife and when set "upright" rather than inverted.<br/><br/>1/2 pig's head (4.5 pounds)<br/>2 pig's feet (1.75 pounds total)<br/>3 pig tongues (2 pounds total)<br/>6 quarts cold water (or as needed)<br/>Several small, fresh thyme sprigs<br/>4 bay leaves<br/>1 teaspoon black peppercorns<br/>1/2 cinnamon stick<br/>4 whole cloves<br/>25 allspice berries, cracked<br/>1/2 teaspoon corriander seed<br/>1/8 piece nutmeg<br/>Several large parsley sprigs<br/>2 celery stalks<br/>1 large carrot, peeled and cut in half<br/>1 small onion, peeled and cut in half<br/>75 grams (1/4 cup) kosher salt<br/><br/><br/>Rinse the head, feet (trotters) and tongues under cold water. Remove and discard the brain from the cut side of the head. Place the pig parts into a large stockpot and cover with cold water by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil and skim off the scum that floats to the top. <br/><br/>While the pot is heating, place the thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, cloves, allspice, corriander seeds and nutmeg onto a small square of cheesecloth and tie into a loose bundle with kitchen twine. Tie the parsley together with twine to make it easier to remove. <br/><br/>Reduce heat to a simmer and add the spice bundle, parsley, celery, carrot, onion and salt to the pot. Cook gently for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until the meats are very tender. Skim foam from the surface as needed.<br/><br/>Using long tongs, remove the tongues after the pot has been simmering for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel and cut off the skin with a small knife. Trim away any grissle and cut the tongue meat into irregular 1/2-inch pieces. Put into a bowl with a little of the cooking liquid and keep warm in a low oven while the rest of the pork cooks.<br/><br/>When the meats are tender, carefully move the head and feet to a large tray to cool. Pick through the trotters and keep any bits of meat found around the knuckles. Remove all the meat from the head, plus some of the snout (not quite meat, not quite fat) and a little of the soft, tender skin pieces. Chop the meat into irregular pieces from about 1/2-inch to an inch each. Cut the snout and skin pieces smaller, about 1/4-inch. Mix the tongue pieces with the head and feet meats.<br/><br/>Pour the stock through a fine mesh strainer into another large pot. Scoop a large ladleful of broth onto a plate and chill to check the geletin content. When cooled, maked sure the gel has set up nicely and springs back when pressed. If not, return it to the heat and simmer to reduce it somewhat, then check again.<br/><br/>Line a loaf pan or terrine with plastic wrap and fill with the meats. Pour enough cooking liquid into the mold to completly cover, then tap the pan on the counter to try to remove trapped air bubbles. Fold the plastic wrap over the top and chill the testa overnight. To serve, remove from the mold and slice thinly. Eat at room temperature with crusty bread or on a warm plate to soften the gelatin.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
