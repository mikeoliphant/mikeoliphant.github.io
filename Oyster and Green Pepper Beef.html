<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Oyster and Green Pepper Beef</div><br/><br/>Oyster sauce can be a really nice addition to almost any chinese dish ordinarily flavored with just soy sauce.

Stir the cooking sauce and add it to the pan. Cook, stirring until sauce bubbles and thickens.<br/><br/>Serve with plain, short-grained rice or over chinese egg noodles. <br/><br/></div></body>
