<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Cochinita Pibil - RR</div><br/><br/>From Robert Rodrigez on You-Tube. <br/><br/>Annatto seeds are very hard and cannot be ground in a mortor and pestle. A coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices works well.<br/><br/>5 tablespoons annatto seeds<br/>2 teaspoons cumin seeds<br/>1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br/>8 whole allspice berries<br/>1/2 teaspoon whole cloves<br/>2 seeded habanero peppers<br/>1/2 cup orange juice<br/>1/2 cup vinegar<br/>juice of 5 lemons<br/>2 tablespoons salt<br/>8 garlic cloves<br/>Dash tequilla<br/>5 pounds boneless pork butt, cut in 2-inch squares<br/>Banana leaves<br/><br/><br/>Grind the annatto seeds to a fine powder using a spice grinder. Repeat with the cumin seeds, peppercorns, allspice and cloves.<br/><br/>Place the liquids, salt, garlic, and powdered spices into a blender and blend well. Combine the marinade with pork chunks in a large ziplock bag. Refrigerate a couple hours or overnight.<br/><br/>Line a baking dish with banana leaves. Pour the pork and marinade into the dish and wrap with the leaves. Roast in a preheated, 325 degree oven for 4 hours. Remove from oven and let rest 20 minutes. Serve with plain rice and a simple green salad.<br/><br/></div></body>
