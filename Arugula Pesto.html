<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Arugula Pesto</div><br/><br/>Arugula pesto keeps its bright, vibrant green color much better than its basil counterpart. You can use extra virgin olive oil if you'd like, but strongly flavored versions have a tendency to over-power the flavors of the arugula and cheese.  <br/>Makes about 1 cup.<br/><br/>2 cups tightly packed, baby arugula<br/>1 cup tightly packed, baby spinach<br/>1-3 tablespoons sliced almonds<br/>1 clove garlic<br/>1/3 cup olive oil<br/>1/2 cup (2 oz) finely shredded Pecorino Romano<br/>1/4-1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br/><br/><br/>Put the garlic into the bowl of a food processor and pulse to mince.  Add the almonds and process finely.  Pack the arugula and spinach into the bowl.  Pulse about 30 seconds to finely chop the greens, scraping the sides of the bowl for even processing. Pour in most of the olive oil and blend to mix.  Add the Pecorino Romano and salt.  Pulse to incorporate, but don't over mix or the bright green color will turn cloudy.  Add additional olive oil if you'd like a saucier, looser version.  <br/><br/></div></body>
