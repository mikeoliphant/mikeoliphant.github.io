<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Huevos Verdes</div><br/><br/>Serves 4.<br/><br/>1 recipe (approx. 2 cups) Roasted Tomatillo Salsa - Salsa Verde<br/>1 (7 oz) can whole green chiles, rinsed and diced<br/>1/2 cup chicken broth<br/>8 corn tortillas<br/>3/4 cup (3-4 oz) shredded jack, mozzarella or queso anejo cheese<br/>8 large eggs<br/>2 teaspoons butter<br/>1 ripe avocado, diced (preferably haas)<br/>2 ripe plum tomatoes, diced<br/>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br/><br/><br/>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.<br/><br/>Pour the Roasted Tomatillo Salsa into a small sauce pan.  Add the diced green chiles and chicken broth and bring to a low simmer.  Taste and adjust seasoning (salt) if required.<br/><br/>Lightly oil a baking sheet.  Place four tortillas on the sheet and top with about half of the cheese (about 1/2 oz on each).  Place in the oven until the cheese just begins to melt, about 3-5 minutes.  Top each with a second tortilla and sprinkle with a few drops of water.  Return to the oven for another 3-5 minutes.  Keep warm while cooking the eggs, but don't let the tortillas dry out.<br/><br/>Heat a 10-inch non-stick fry pan over medium-high heat.  Melt the butter and add the eggs.  After the whites begin to set, pour about 2 tablespoons water along the edge of the pan and cover with a lid.  Reduce the heat and cook 1-2 minutes until the whites are set, but the yolks are still runny.<br/><br/>Place one tortilla stack on each of four warmed plates.  Spoon a little sauce over the tortillas, then place two eggs on each.  Top with about 1/3 cup sauce per plate and garnish with the extra cheese, avocado, tomato and cilantro.  Serve immediately with Cumin Scented Black Beans along side.<br/><br/>Extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to one week.<br/><br/> <br/><br/></div></body>
