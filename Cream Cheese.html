<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Cream Cheese</div><br/><br/>Mesophillic M created a buttery cheese. I used half cream-top and half homogenized milk -- the cream separated a lot, making the cheese more solid.<br/><br/>Mesophillic A created a more tangy cheese, although to make it even more flavorful, I should keep the temperature higher all night (over 72). I used all homogenzied milk, pluse 3 drops rennet and didn't have any problems with the cream separating - much creamier.<br/><br/>The best version is easiest - see below...<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Simple Cream Cheese:</div><br/>This simple cream cheese has an appealing fresh, slightly tangy flavor and it’s super easy to make. The basic steps are: <br/><br/>1 – add starter culture and rennet to room temperature milk and cream, let it sit for a day <br/>2 – drain the curds in cheese cloth for another day <br/>3 – add salt and flavorings (optional)<br/>4 – eat and enjoy!<br/><br/>Important: make sure your milk and cream are pasteurized and not ultra-pasteurized. If you can’t find regular pasteurized cream, decrease the milk by a cup and use 2 cups of pasteurized half-and-half instead of the cream.<br/><br/>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">Ingredients:</div><br/>1 cup heavy cream (pasteurized, but not ultra-pasteurized)<br/>1/2 gallon whole milk (pasteurized, but not ultra-pasteurized)<br/>1 packet mesophilic direct-set starter (1/4 t)<br/>4 drops liquid rennet<br/>1- 1 ½ teaspoons Morton's kosher salt ( ½ - ¾ t if using regular table salt)<br/><br/><br/>Stir together the milk and cream, then let it come to room temp: leave it in a warm place a few hours, or put it on the stove top on very low, or put it into a barely warm turned-off oven (do not microwave). <br/><br/>Sprinkle the mesophilic starter over the milk, let it sit a couple minutes, and then stir it in gently, but thoroughly. Add the rennet and stir another 60 seconds. Cover and let sit 18-24 hours. <br/><br/>Gently ladle the curds into a colander lined with fine cheese cloth -- I like to do this over a large bowl. Carefully lift the corners of the cheese cloth and tie them together. Hang from a cupboard knob or other convenient place and place a bowl beneath to catch the drips. Leave alone for 12-24 hours. The longer you wait, the stiffer the cheese will be. <br/><br/>Turn the cream cheese into a bowl and use a wooden spoon to mix in the salt. (Note - the salt will dissolve and become more uniform tasting after the cheese has rested for a few hours.) If you want to add flavorings (herbs, garlic, pepper, fruit) to portions of the cream cheese it's easiest to that now while it’s warm. Or it's great plain too.<br/><br/><br/></div></body>
