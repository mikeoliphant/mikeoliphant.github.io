<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Chori-Migas</div><br/><br/>Serves 2.<br/><br/>We start by cooking the chorizo whole and removing the casing once the sausage is cooked through. This results in decent sized chunks of meat in the end product. If you like, you can remove the sausage from its casing prior to cooking, however you will end up with smaller, finer pieces of cooked chorizo.<br/><br/>1 tablespoon canola oil<br/>3 oz Mexican Chorizo, preferably Oaxacan<br/>3 corn tortillas, torn into rough 1-2 inch pieces<br/>1/2 onion, sliced or chopped<br/>1 garlic clove, minced<br/>4 eggs, lightly scrambled<br/>Kosher salt<br/>1 jalapeno or serano chile, thinly sliced<br/>A bit of queso fresco or monterey jack cheese for garnish<br/><br/><br/>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan until medium hot. Add the chorizo and cook, turning frequently until the sausage is bursting from its casings. Use scissors or a small knife to slit the casings and tongs or a fork to remove them from the pan, leaving the meat and oil behind.<br/><br/>Add the tortillas and stir well to coat them in the flavored oil. Cook a minute or two, then add the onion and cook for another couple of minutes until some of the tortillas begin to crisp and the onion has softened. Sprinkle everything with salt, then stir in the garlic and cook another 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Pour the eggs over the chorizo-tortilla mixture, and use a rubber spatula to stir gently until the eggs are set, but still moist. Fold in some of the chile slices, then serve on warmed plates. Garnish with a little cheese, more chile slices and some finely chopped cilantro if desired.<br/><br/><br/></div></body>
