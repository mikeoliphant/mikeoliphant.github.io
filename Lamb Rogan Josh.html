<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Lamb Rogan Josh</div><br/><br/>This recipe is something like lamb rogan josh. It has a nice savory taste, perked up by the fresh tomatoes added at the end.<br/><br/>4 tablespoons oil<br/>1 medium onion, chopped small<br/>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic<br/>1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger<br/>1 teaspoon cumin<br/>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander<br/>Salt (to taste)<br/>1-2 teaspoons Indian chilli powder<br/>3-6 long, skinny green chillies (optional - if using, indian or thai are preferable, but serrano or jalapeno will do)<br/>1 large bunch fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped (coriander)<br/>Approx. 1/3 recipe Ubiquitous Curry Base Sauce<br/>1-1 1/2 pounds lamb, trimmed and cut into 1 to 2-inch cubes<br/>Beef stock cube, enough for 2 cups<br/>2-3 tomatoes, sliced into wedges<br/><br/><br/>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add cumin, ground coriander, garlic, ginger, and onion. Cook while stirring until onions are wilted.<br/><br/>Add the lamb and cook until browned. You can use pre-cooked lamb if you like –  we sometimes have a lamb roast and then use leftovers for curry.<br/><br/>Add “Base Sauce” and beef stock and stir to mix. Add chilli powder to get the spice level you want. Simmer covered for about 10 minutes.  If it seems soupy, crack the lid to condense the sauce.<br/><br/>Add a large handful of the cilantro and mix it in. If you use the green chillies, remove the seeds, slice in long thin strips and add them now. Simmer for another 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Add another small handful of cilantro and the tomato wedges a few minutes before serving. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed.<br/><br/>Serve with rice (plain Basmati or Pulao) and flat-bread.<br/><br/></div></body>
