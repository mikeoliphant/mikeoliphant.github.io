<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Kohlrabi Risotto</div><br/><br/>Used chicken stock with four morrel mushrooms soaked in it (used mushrooms in another dish). Put kohlrabi in half way through -- next time, try lightly browning it first. Used a bit of mascarpone and a fair amount of parmesan at the end. Probably sweated some shallots in a mix of butter and olive oil at the beginning, but don't quite remember!<br/><br/></div></body>
