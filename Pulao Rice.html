<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Pulao Rice</div><br/><br/>This is the rice we have with curries. The amounts are quite variable – if you use less rice, reduce the onion, etc. Using standard methods, it can be made up to 45 minutes before eating. Using a rice cooker, it can be made up to several hours before eating.<br/><br/>1 1/2 cups basmati rice (cups are "rice-cooker" cups)<br/>2 teaspoons canola oil<br/>1/2 onion, chopped small<br/>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br/>2 green cardamom pods<br/>Low sodium chicken broth<br/>1 small carrot, peeled and finely grated<br/>1 bay leaf<br/>3/4 teaspoon salt<br/><br/><br/>In a small fry pan, heat oil and add onion and cumin — sauté.<br/><br/>Press cardamom pod with the side of a knife to open the tip slightly and add it to the pan. <br/><br/>When onion is soft (about 5 minutes) stir in half of the carrot and cook another minute. Remove from heat.<br/><br/>In the rice cooker bowl, wash rice three (yes three) times. Do this by running cold water into the pan, swirling it with the rice, and then draining the cloudy water away. Add broth to the appropiate "cup" measurement line for your rice cooker (about 1 1/2 cups of broth).<br/><br/>Dump onion mixture, plus extra carrot and bay leaf into the rice. Add salt, stir to mix and start the rice cooker.<br/><br/>When the rice cooker beeps, fluff the rice. Remove bay leaf and cardamom when you are ready to eat.<br/><br/></div></body>
