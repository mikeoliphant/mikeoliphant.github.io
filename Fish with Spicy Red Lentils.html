<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Fish with Spicy Red Lentils</div><br/><br/>These lentils are fabulous. You will need to add 1/2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, depending upon the saltiness of your broth or stock. Plenty of seasoning is important for this dish.<br/>Serves 4.<br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The lentils:</div><br/>1 scant cup (6 ounces) red lentils<br/>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric<br/>1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br/>3/4 cup water<br/>Fish stock base (cube or paste) for 1 cup<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The split peas:</div><br/>1/4 cup dried yellow split peas<br/>1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth<br/>1/3 cup water<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The rest:</div><br/>2 tablespoons canola oil<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds<br/>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger<br/>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br/>1 pound firm white fish fillets, skinned and cut into large chunks<br/>1/4 cup chopped cilantro<br/>Approx. 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (to taste)<br/>Lemon wedges and additional chopped cilantro for garnish<br/><br/><br/>In a small saucepan heat 1/3 cup of the chicken broth and 1/3 cup of water. Stir in the yellow peas, cover and simmer about 30 minutes or until peas are just tender. Remove from heat.<br/><br/>While the peas are cooking, put 3/4 cup water, the fish stock base and the 1 3/4 cup chicken broth into a high sided, heavy bottomed pan or dutch oven and bring to a boil. Add the lentils and turmeric, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20-25 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked peas to the lentil pot and stir to combine. Add salt to taste and reduce the heat to very low.<br/><br/>Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a small frying pan. When hot, add the cumin seeds. Stir briefly and when they begin to pop and turn dark brown, stir in the ginger and cayenne. Cook another 60 seconds until the ginger is soft and begins to brown. Pour the hot spice mixture over the lentils. Add the lemon juice and stir.<br/><br/>Return the lentils to a low simmer. Lay the fish pieces over the lentils, cover and cook gently for about 10-15 minutes or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily. Keep the heat fairly low in order to avoid scorching the lentils at the bottom of the pan. Gently stir in the chopped cilantro being careful to keep the fish pieces intact.<br/><br/>Serve while hot, garnishing with extra chopped cilantro and the lemon wedges.<br/><br/></div></body>
