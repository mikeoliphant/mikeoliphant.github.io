<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Eggs Soft Cooked for Ramen</div><br/><br/>1. Place cold eggs in a pan or pot with apx 1 cm of cold water. Yup, that's right, the eggs will not be fully immersed in the water. One cm deep of water is plenty for this method. Put the lid on the pan/pot and don't take it off until the very last step.<br/>2. Bring water to a boil on High Heat.<br/>3. As soon as the water boils, turn heat down to Medium.<br/>4. Cook at Medium Heat for 4 min.<br/>5. Immediately after these 4 min, remove from heat and let eggs sit in hot water, 3 min.<br/>6. Quickly chill eggs in cold water briefly to cool down the eggs for easy peeling.<br/>7. Peel and enjoy!<br/><br/></div></body>
