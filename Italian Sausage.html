<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Italian Sausage</div><br/><br/>Two teaspoon chile flakes results in a medium spicy sausage. Adjust up or down to your taste.<br/><br/>The sausage meat is easier to grind and stuff into casings if kept quite cold. Over-working along with too much warmth softens the fat and can result in a spongy textured sausage.<br/><br/>2 1/2 pounds pork shoulder (with plenty of fat)<br/>2 teaspoons fennel seeds<br/>2-3 garlic cloves, minced<br/>1/3 cup dry white wine<br/>1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seed<br/>2 teaspoons red chile flakes<br/>3 teaspoons kosher salt<br/>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br/><br/><br/>Cut meat into finger-shaped strips. Grind coarsely with a meat grinder. Chill 1 hour. Use your hands to thoroughly mix in the seasonings (use a light hand and work quickly to keep the fat from going mushy). Pinch off about a tablespoon of sausage and cook it in a small fry pan. Taste for seasoning - add additional chile or salt if required. Chill the sausage meat at least 2 hours or overnight.<br/><br/>Select 2 or 3 lengths of hog casings and place into a sink full of cool water. Hydrate for about 10 minutes, then scoop up the casings and replace the salty water with fresh water. Rinse the inside of each casing by holding the end open with two fingers and allow a thin stream of cool water to enter the casing and expand it. Empty each casing then repeat the rinse.<br/><br/>Feed the casing onto a sausage stuffer tube and stuff with cold sausage meat. Pack the sausages fairly full, but don't over-stuff. Twist the resulting sausage into links 4 to 5 inches long. Chill a couple hours before cutting apart into individual links. Freeze any sausages that won't be used within a couple of days.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
