<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Beanadilla</div><br/><br/>These are a lower fat, yet substantial take on a quesadilla, using non-fat refried beans as the primary filler instead of cheese.  You can add an assortment of fillings, but something salty or with a little kick, along with something fresh or crunchy works best.<br/>Serves two as breakfast, or four as appetizer.<br/><br/>2 (8 inch) flour tortillas<br/>1/4 cup non-fat refried beans (canned)<br/>1-2 tablespoons cooked chicken or  ham<br/>1 ounce melting cheese (mozzarella, jack, gruyere, etc)<br/>1-2 tablespoons diced bell pepper (red or green)<br/>1 tablespoon diced onions (optional)<br/><br/><br/>Heat a 10-inch frying pan to medium.<br/><br/>Using the back of a large spoon, spread the beans evenly over one of the tortillas. Place the coated tortilla into the frying pan, bean side up.<br/><br/>Sprinkle the cooked meat and diced vegetables over the beans.  Shread or cube the cheese, and distribute it evenly over the filling.  When the bottom of the tortilla becomes light brown and slightly crisped, place the second tortilla over everything.  <br/><br/>Invert a small (6-inch) plate and place on the tortilla in the pan .  With one hand, hold the plate steady  and with the other hand, turn the pan over to deposit the bean-adilla onto the plate.  Return the pan to the heat and slide bean-adilla back into the pan, uncooked tortilla on the bottom.  <br/><br/>Cook for a few more minutes, or until bottom tortilla turns light brown and slightly crisp.  Slide bean-adilla onto a cutting board and allow to cool for a couple minutes so that the beans and cheese will set up somewhat.  Slice into 4 to 8 wedges, and serve warm.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
