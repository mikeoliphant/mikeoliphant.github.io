<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Smoked Meatloaf</div><br/><br/>Used our standard meatloaf recipe, but cooked it as follows:<br/><br/>Prepared meatloaf disk on a round piece of parchment paper. Prepared smoker with empty waterpan (lined with foil to catch drips), one layer of cold briquets, 20 fully lit briquets in the center. Used 1 medium (4-oz) piece of hickory wood and 2 small (2-oz) pieces of apple wood.<br/><br/>Smoked the meatloaf at around 280 degrees for an hour and 45 minutes, then near 300 degrees for another 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of about 150 degrees. Rested 20 minutes before serving. <br/><br/>Loaf was a little soft; next time I would cook it a little harder, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
