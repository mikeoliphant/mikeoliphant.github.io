<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Anticuchos</div><br/><br/>1 pound beef heart<br/>2 teaspoons olive oil<br/>1/2 teaspoon annatto seeds<br/>2 garlic cloves, minced<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons aji paste<br/>1/4 teaspoon salt<br/>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br/>1 pinch black pepper<br/>1 teaspoon oregano, rubbed<br/>1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br/><br/><br/>Trim beef heart well, removing all fat, valves and membranes.  Slice into 1/2 inch thick pieces, about 1 inch wide and 2 inches long. <br/><br/>Gently heat the annatto seeds in the oil 2-3 minutes, or until oil is colored red.  Discard seeds, allow oil to cool.<br/><br/>In a small bowl, stir the remaining ingredients together and mix well.  Place the heart into a non-reactive bowl and pour the marinade over.  Add the annatto oil and stir throroughly to evenly coat the heart pieces.  Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.<br/><br/>After marinating, thread the meat onto skewers.  Cook on a hot barbeque grill, about 2 minutes per side, or until just cooked through (medium, not well done).  Brush the meat with marinade several times while cooking.  Serve with lightly grilled corn on the cob and simple boiled potatoes.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div></body>
