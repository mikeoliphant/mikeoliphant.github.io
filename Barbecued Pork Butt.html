<div class="Recipe"><div class="RecipeTitle">Barbecued Pork Butt</div><br/><br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The Spice Rub:</div><br/>1 tablespoon paprika<br/>1 tablespoon chili powder<br/>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br/>1 tablespoon garlic powder<br/>1 tablespoon brown sugar<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard<br/>1 teaspoon dry sage<br/>1 teaspoon dried oregano<br/>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper<br/>2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt<br/><br/><br/><div class="RecipeSectionTitle">The Vinegar Sauce:</div><br/>3/4 cup cider vinegar<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br/>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar<br/>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br/>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br/><br/><br/>1 (6-8 pound) bone-in pork butt<br/>Several cups of hardwood chips (hickory and alder), soaked for 2 hours.<br/><br/><br/>Thoroughly mix together the ingredients for the Spice Rub. Sprinkle the rub evenly all over the meat giving it a generous coating. Wrap the seasoned meat tightly in plastic wrap, place on a tray to catch any escaping juices, and refrigerate overnight.<br/><br/>Unwrap the meat and let sit at room temperature while preparing the grill.  Using a gas barbecue grill, remove one grill plate and center the other in the grill area.  Light one burner to the left or right of the grill plate and put a wood chip smoker box filled with damp wood chips near the lit burner -- bring them to a smolder.  Place the seasoned meat on the grill, fat side up, and close the grill lid.  <br/><br/>Maintain a grill temperature of 200 to 250 degrees, replenishing the wood chips as necessary to achieve a consistent smoke level. Cook the pork until the internal temperature reaches at least 180 degrees; for improved tenderness, shoot for closer to 190 degrees. Cooking time will take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours depending upon the roast size and grill temperature.<br/><br/>Due to the long cooking time, the wood chip smoker box will fill with ashes, reducing its effectiveness. Every few hours, use tongs to remove the box and empty the ashes into a metal container before refilling with damp wood chips. If needed, turn on a second burner for a few minutes after opening the lid to restore the temperature level and jumpstart the chip smoker. <br/><br/>When the meat is done, carefully transfer it from the grill to a tray. Cover with foil and drape with kitchen towels, then allow it to rest 30 minutes. Prepare the vinegar sauce by mixing the ingredients until the sugar and salt have completely dissolved. Once the meat has rested, use two forks to pull the meat into shreds and transfer to a large bowl. Pour about 1/4 cup of the vinegar sauce over the meat and mix gently, but well.  Use additional sauce to taste.  Serve warm or at room temperature.<br/><br/></div></body>
